        "html_text": " : The North Pole , also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole , is the point in the where the meets its surface. It is called the True North Pole to distinguish from the . The North Pole is by definition the northernmost point on the Earth, lying to the . It defines geodetic 90° North, as well as the direction of . At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. No time zone has been assigned to the North Pole, so any time can be used as the local time. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere. The nearest land is usually said to be , off the northern coast of about 700 km (430 mi) away, though some perhaps semi-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer. The nearest permanently inhabited place is in the , Nunavut, Canada, which is located 817 km (508 mi) from the Pole. While the South Pole lies on a continental , the North Pole is located in the middle of the amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting . The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at 4,261 m (13,980 ft) by the Russian in and at 4,087 m (13,409 ft) by in 1958. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole ( ). However, the , and later Russia, constructed a number of on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, a group of Russians have also annually established a private base, , close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring. Studies in the 2000s predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice-free because of , with timescales varying from 2016 to the late 21st century or later. Attempts to reach the North Pole began in the late 19th century, with the record for being surpassed on numerous occasions. The first undisputed expedition to reach the North Pole was that of the airship , which overflew the area in 1926 with 16 men on board, including expedition leader . Three prior expeditions – led by (1908, land), (1909, land) and (1926, aerial) – were once also accepted as having reached the Pole. However, in each case later analysis of expedition data has cast doubt upon the accuracy of their claims. The first confirmed overland expedition to reach the North Pole was in 1968 by , Walt Pederson, Gerry Pitzl and Jean-Luc Bombardier, using snowmobiles and with air support. The Earth's axis of rotation – and hence the position of the North Pole – was commonly believed to be fixed (relative to the surface of the Earth) until, in the 18th century, the mathematician predicted that the axis might wobble slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent variation of latitude, as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth's surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth's axis and the Earth's surface, at any given moment, is called the instantaneous pole, but because of the wobble this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required. It is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevations or ) to fixed landforms. However, given and , there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the and the have defined a framework called the . As early as the 16th century, many prominent people correctly believed that the North Pole was in a sea, which in the 19th century was called the or . It was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year. Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes. One of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer , who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. In 1871, the , a US attempt on the Pole led by , ended in disaster. Another British attempt to get to the pole, part of the , by Commander reached a then-record 83°20'26 North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879–1881 expedition commanded by officer ended tragically when their ship, the , was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including De Long, were lost. In April 1895, the Norwegian explorers and struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen's icebound ship . The pair reached latitude 86°14′ North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching . In 1897, Swedish engineer and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon Örnen (Eagle), but came down 300 km (190 mi) north of , the northeasternmost part of the archipelago. They trekked to Kvitøya but died there three months after their crash. In 1930 the remains of were found by the Norwegian . The Italian explorer and Captain of the (Regia Marina) sailed the converted whaler (Pole Star) from Norway in 1899. On 11 March 1900, Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86° 34’ on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen's result of 1895 by 35 to 40 km (22 to 25 mi). Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until 23 June. On 16 August, the Stella Polare left heading south and the expedition returned to Norway. The US explorer claimed to have reached the North Pole on 21 April 1908 with two men, Ahwelah and Etukishook, but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted. The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to US Navy engineer , who claimed to have reached the Pole on 6 April 1909, accompanied by and four Inuit men, Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Peary's claim remains highly disputed and controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole. The distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Peary's account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line – the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing – is contradicted by Henson's account of tortuous detours to avoid and . The British explorer , initially a supporter of Peary, researched Peary's records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer's navigational records. He concluded that Peary had not reached the Pole. Support for Peary came again in 2005, however, when British explorer and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey with replica wooden sleds and teams, reaching the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours – nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery's fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles (170 km), significantly short of the 135 nautical miles (250 km) claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from . Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole. The first claimed flight over the Pole was made on 9 May 1926 by US naval officer and pilot in a aircraft. Although verified at the time by a committee of the , this claim has since been undermined by the 1996 revelation that Byrd's long-hidden diary's solar data (which the NGS never checked) consistently contradict his June 1926 report's parallel data by over 100 mi (160 km). The secret report's alleged en-route solar sextant data were inadvertently so impossibly overprecise that he excised all these alleged raw solar observations out of the version of the report finally sent to geographical societies five months later (while the original version was hidden for 70 years), a realization first published in 2000 by the after scrupulous refereeing. The first consistent, verified, and scientifically convincing attainment of the Pole was on 12 May 1926, by Norwegian explorer and his US sponsor from the . Norge , though Norwegian-owned, was designed and piloted by the Italian . The flight started from in Norway, and crossed the Arctic Ocean to Alaska. Nobile, with several scientists and crew from the Norge , overflew the Pole a second time on 24 May 1928, in the airship . The Italia crashed on its return from the Pole, with the loss of half the crew. was accomplished in a Tupolev ANT-25 airplane with a crew of , and , who flew over the North Pole on 19 June 1937, during their direct flight from the Soviet Union to the USA without any stopover. In May 1937 the world's first , , was established by Soviet scientists 20 kilometres (13 mi) from the North Pole after the ever first landing of four heavy and one light aircraft onto the ice at the North Pole. The expedition members — oceanographer , meteorologist , radio operator , and the leader — conducted scientific research at the station for the next nine months. By 19 February 1938, when the group was picked up by the ice breakers and Murman , their station had drifted 2850 km to the eastern coast of Greenland. In May 1945 an of the Aries expedition became the first aircraft to overfly the North Geographic and North Magnetic Poles. The plane was piloted by David Cecil McKinley of the . It carried an 11-man crew, with Kenneth C. Maclure of the in charge of all scientific observations. In 2006, Maclure was honoured with a spot in . Discounting Peary's disputed claim, the first men to set foot at the North Pole were a Soviet party including geophysicists Mikhail Ostrekin and Pavel Senko, oceanographers Mikhail Somov and Pavel Gordienko, and other scientists and flight crew (24 people in total) of 's Sever-2 expedition (March–May 1948). It was organized by the . The party flew on three planes (pilots Ivan Cherevichnyy, Vitaly Maslennikov and Ilya Kotov) from to the North Pole and landed there at 4:44pm ( , ) on 23 April 1948. They established a temporary camp and for the next two days conducted scientific observations. On 26 April the expedition flew back to the continent. Next year, on 9 May 1949 two other Soviet scientists (Vitali Volovich and Andrei Medvedev) became the first people to parachute onto the North Pole. They jumped from a , registered CCCP H-369. On 3 May 1952, Lieutenant Colonel and Lieutenant , along with scientist , landed a modified at the North Pole. Some Western sources considered this to be the first landing at the Pole until the Soviet landings became widely known. The United States Navy submarine (SSN-571) crossed the North Pole on 3 August 1958. On 17 March 1959 (SSN-578) surfaced at the Pole, breaking through the ice above it, becoming the first naval vessel to do so. The first confirmed surface conquest of the North Pole was accomplished by , Walt Pederson, Gerry Pitzl and Jean Luc Bombardier, who traveled over the ice by and arrived on 19 April 1968. The United States Air Force independently confirmed their position. On 6 April 1969 and companions Allan Gill, and Kenneth Hedges of the British Trans-Arctic Expedition became the first men to reach the North Pole on foot (albeit with the aid of and ). They continued on to complete the first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean – and by its longest axis, , to – a feat that has never been repeated. Because of suggestions (later proven false) of Plaisted's use of air transport, some sources classify Herbert's expedition as the first confirmed to reach the North Pole over the ice surface by any means. In the 1980s Plaisted's pilots and Ken Lee signed affidavits asserting that no such airlift was provided. It is also said that Herbert was the first person to reach the . On 17 August 1977 the Soviet completed the first surface vessel journey to the North Pole. In 1982 and became the first people to cross the Arctic Ocean in a single season. They departed from Cape Crozier, , on 17 February 1982 and arrived at the geographic North Pole on 10 April 1982. They travelled on foot and snowmobile. From the Pole, they travelled towards Svalbard but, due to the unstable nature of the ice, ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days. They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship MV Benjamin Bowring and boarded it on 4 August 1982 at position 80:31N 00:59W. As a result of this journey, which formed a section of the three-year 1979–1982, Fiennes and Burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles, by surface travel alone. This achievement remains unchallenged to this day. The expedition crew included a named who became the first dog to visit both poles. In 1985 (the first man to stand on the summit of Mount Everest) and (the first man to stand on the moon) landed at the North Pole in a small twin-engined ski plane. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest. In 1986 , with seven teammates, became the first to be confirmed as reaching the Pole by dogsled and without resupply. operated in the Arctic Ocean under the polar ice cap from September to November 1984 in company with one of her sister ships, the attack submarine . On 12 November 1984 Gurnard and Pintado became the third pair of submarines to surface together at the North Pole. In March 1990, Gurnard deployed to the Arctic region during exercise Ice Ex '90 and completed only the fourth winter submerged transit of the Bering and Seas. Gurnard surfaced at the North Pole on 18 April, in the company of the . On 6 May 1986 , and surfaced at the North Pole, the first tri-submarine surfacing at the North Pole. On 21 April 1987 of Japan became the first person to reach the North Pole on a . On 18 May 1987 , and surfaced at the North Pole, the first international surfacing at the North Pole. In 1988 a team of 13 (9 Soviets, 4 Canadians) from Siberia to northern Canada. One of the Canadians, , became the first person to reach the Pole from both sides of the Arctic Ocean. On April 16, 1990, a German-Swiss expedition led by a team of the reached the Geographic North Pole for studies on pollution of , snow and air. Samples taken were analyzed in cooperation with the and the . Further stops for sample collections were on multi-year at 86°N, at and . On 4 May 1990 and became the first explorers ever to reach the North Pole unsupported, after a 58-day ski trek from Ellesmere Island in Canada, a distance of 800 km. On 7 September 1991 the German research vessel and the Swedish reached the North Pole as the first conventional powered vessels. Both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common and a game on an ice floe. Polarstern again reached the pole exactly 10 years later, with the . In 1998, 1999, and 2000, Marshs (special very large wheeled versions made by BRONTO, Lada/Vaz's experimental product division) were driven to the North Pole. The 1998 expedition was dropped by parachute and completed the track to the North Pole. The 2000 expedition departed from a Russian research base around 114 km from the Pole and claimed an average speed of 20–15 km/h in an average temperature of −30 °C. Commercial airliner flights on the may pass within viewing distance of the North Pole. For example, a flight from to may come close as latitude 89° N, though because of prevailing winds return journeys go over the . In recent years journeys to the North Pole by air (landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice) or by icebreaker have become relatively routine, and are even available to small groups of tourists through companies. Parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the North Pole in recent years. The temporary seasonal Russian camp of has been established by air a short distance from the Pole annually since 2002, and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties. Trips from the camp to the Pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter. The first attempt at exploration of the North Pole was made on 22 April 1998 by Russian firefighter and diver Andrei Rozhkov with the support of the Diving Club of , but ended in fatality. The next attempted dive at the North Pole was organized the next year by the same diving club, and ended in success on 24 April 1999. The divers were Michael Wolff (Austria), Brett Cormick (UK), and Bob Wass (USA). In 2005 the United States Navy submarine (SSN-766) surfaced through 155 cm (61 in) of ice at the North Pole and spent 18 hours there. In July 2007 British endurance swimmer completed a 1 km (0.62 mi) swim at the North Pole. His feat, undertaken to highlight the , took place in clear water that had opened up between the ice floes. His later attempt to paddle a to the North Pole in late 2008, following the erroneous prediction of clear water to the Pole, was stymied when his expedition found itself stuck in thick ice after only three days. The expedition was then abandoned. By September 2007 the North Pole had been visited 66 times by different surface ships: 54 times by Soviet and Russian icebreakers, 4 times by Swedish Oden , 3 times by German , 3 times by and , and once by and by Swedish . On 2 August 2007 a Russian scientific expedition made the first ever manned descent to the ocean floor at the North Pole, to a depth of 4.3 km (2.7 mi), as part of the research programme in support of Russia's to a large swathe of the Arctic Ocean floor. The descent took place in two and was led by Soviet and Russian polar explorer . In a symbolic act of visitation, the was placed on the ocean floor exactly at the Pole. The expedition was the latest in a series of efforts intended to give Russia a dominant influence in the according to . The warming and summer shrinkage of the iced area has attracted the attention of many countries, such as China and the United States, toward the top of the world, where resources and shipping routes may soon be exploitable. In 2009 the Russian with as a leader and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Sergey Larin, Alexey Ushakov and Nikolay Nikulshin reached the North Pole on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs. The vehicles, Yemelya-1 and Yemelya-2, were designed by Vasily Elagin, a Russian mountain climber, explorer and engineer. They reached the North Pole on 26 April 2009, 17:30 (Moscow time). The expedition was partly supported by Russian State Aviation. The Russian Book of Records recognized it as the first successful vehicle trip from land to the Geographical North Pole. On 1 March 2013 the Russian Marine Live-Ice Automobile Expedition (MLAE 2013) with Vasily Elagin as a leader, and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Andrey Vankov, Sergey Isayev and Nikolay Kozlov on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs—Yemelya-3 and Yemelya-4—started from Golomyanny Island (the Archipelago) to the North Pole across drifting ice of the Arctic Ocean. The vehicles reached the Pole on 6 April and then continued to the Canadian coast. The coast was reached on 30 April 2013 (83°08N, 075°59W ), and on 5 May 2013 the expedition finished in , NU. The way between the Russian borderland (Machtovyi Island of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, 80°15N, 097°27E) and the Canadian coast (Ward Hunt Island, 83°08N, 075°59W) took 55 days; it was ~2300 km across drifting ice and about 4000 km in total. The expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies. The expedition was supported by the . The sun at the North Pole is continuously during the summer and continuously during the winter. is just before the (around 20 March); the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23½° elevation at the summer (around 21 June), after which time it begins to sink, reaching just after the (around 23 September). When the sun is visible in the polar sky, it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon. This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox. Hence the North and South Poles experience the slowest rates of sunrise and sunset on Earth. The period that occurs before sunrise and after sunset has three different definitions: These effects are caused by a combination of the Earth's and its revolution around the sun. The direction of the Earth's axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods). At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference. In most places on Earth, local time is determined by , such that the time of day is more or less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday, the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole and no particular time zone has been assigned. Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient, such as , or the time zone of the country from which they departed. The North Pole is substantially warmer than the because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat), rather than at altitude on a continental land mass. Despite being an ice cap, the northernmost weather station in Greenland has a tundra climate (Köppen ET ) due to the July and August mean temperatures peaking just above freezing. Winter temperatures at the in Greenland can range from about −50 to −13 °C (−58 to 9 °F), averaging around −31 °C (−24 °F), with the North Pole being slightly colder. However, a freak storm caused the temperature to reach 0.7 °C (33.3 °F) for a time at a buoy, located at 87.45°N, on 30 December 2015. It was estimated that the temperature at the North Pole was between −1 and 2 °C (30 and 35 °F) during the storm. Summer temperatures (June, July, and August) average around the freezing point (0 °C (32 °F)). The highest temperature yet recorded is 13 °C (55 °F), much warmer than the South Pole's record high of only −12.3 °C (9.9 °F). A similar spike in temperatures occurred on 15 November 2016 when temperatures hit freezing. Yet again, February 2018 featured a storm so powerful that temperatures at Cape Morris Jesup, the world's northernmost weather station in Greenland, reached 6.1 °C (43.0 °F) and spent 24 straight hours above freezing. Meanwhile, the pole itself was estimated to reach a high temperature of 1.6 °C (34.9 °F) . This same temperature of 1.6 °C (34.9 °F) was also recorded at the in at the very same time. The sea ice at the North Pole is typically around 2 to 3 m (6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in) thick, although ice thickness, its spatial extent, and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate. Studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years. It is likely that has contributed to this, but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the Arctic. Reports have also predicted that within a few decades the Arctic Ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer. This may have significant commercial implications; see Territorial claims, below. The retreat of the Arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming, as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation, and may have serious climate implications by contributing to Arctic cyclone generation. are believed to travel rarely beyond about 82° North, owing to the scarcity of food, though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the North Pole, and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just 1 mi (1.6 km) from the Pole. The has also been seen at the Pole, and have been observed less than 60 km (37 mi) away at 89°40′ N. Birds seen at or very near the Pole include the , and , though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions. Fish have been seen in the waters at the North Pole, but these are probably few in number. A member of the Russian team that descended to the North Pole seabed in August 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there. However, it was later reported that a had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the Russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified and . Currently, under , no country owns the North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The five surrounding Arctic countries, Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark (via Greenland), and the United States, are limited to a 200- (370 km; 230 mi) off their coasts, and the area beyond that is administered by the . Upon ratification of the , a country has 10 years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. If validated, such a claim gives the claimant state rights to what may be on or beneath the sea bottom within the claimed zone. Norway (ratified the convention in 1996 ), Russia (ratified in 1997 ), Canada (ratified in 2003 ) and Denmark (ratified in 2004 ) have all launched projects to base claims that certain areas of Arctic continental shelves should be subject to their sole sovereign exploitation. In 1907 Canada invoked a sector principle to claim sovereignty over a sector stretching from its coasts to the North Pole. This claim has not been relinquished, but was not consistently pressed until 2013. In some children's and , the geographic North Pole is described as the location of , although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic North Pole. has assigned postal code to the North Pole (referring to Santa's traditional exclamation of !). This association reflects an age-old esoteric mythology of that posits the North Pole, the otherworldly world-axis, as the abode of God and superhuman beings. As has documented, the North Pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of and Iranian mysticism. The Orient sought by the mystic, the Orient that cannot be located on our maps, is in the direction of the north, beyond the north.. In , the North Pole and are considered to be auspicious, since they are associated with the . face north when praying, and are also oriented towards the north. On the contrary, South is associated with the . Owing to its remoteness, the Pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient tradition called (Jabal Qaf), the farthest point of the earth. According to certain authors, the Jabal Qaf of is a version of , a mountain whose ascent, like climbing of the , represents the pilgrim's progress through spiritual states. In Iranian theosophy, the heavenly Pole, the focal point of the spiritual ascent, acts as a magnet to draw beings to its palaces ablaze with immaterial matter. "

        "html_text": "Scientists are very interested in the North Pole—the northernmost point on Earth 9 - 12+ Biology, Ecology, Earth Science, Geology, Geography, Physical Geography, Social Studies, World History The North Pole is the northernmost point on Earth. It is the precise point of the intersection of Earth's axis and Earth's surface. From the North Pole, all directions are south. Its latitude is 90 degrees north, and all lines of longitude meet there (as well as at the South Pole, on the opposite end of Earth). Polaris , the current North Star, sits almost motionless in the sky above the pole, making it an excellent fixed point to use in celestial navigation in the Northern Hemisphere. The North Pole sits in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, on water that is almost always covered with ice . The ice is about two to three meters (six to 10 feet) thick. The depth of the ocean at the North Pole is more than 4,000 meters (13,123 feet). The Canadian territory of Nunavut lies closest to the North Pole. Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous teterritory within the Kingdom of Denmark, is also close to the pole. The North Pole is much warmer than the South Pole. This is because sits at a lower elevation ( sea level ) and is located in the middle of an ocean, which is warmer than the ice-covered continent of Antarctica. But it's not exactly beach weather . In the summer, the warmest time of year, the temperature is right at the freezing point: 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit.) Because Earth rotates on a tilted axis as it revolves around the sun, sunlight is experienced in extremes at the poles. In fact, the North Pole experiences only one sunrise (at the March equinox ) and one sunset (at the September equinox) every year. From the North Pole, the sun is always above the horizon in the summer and below the horizon in the winter. This means the region experiences up to 24 hours of sunlight in the summer and 24 hours of darkness in the winter. Drifting Research Stations Since the North Pole sits on drifting ice, it's difficult and expensive for scientists and explorers to study. There isn’t land or a place for permanent facilities, making it difficult to set up equipment. The most consistent research of the North Pole has come from manned drifting research stations. Russia sends out a drifting station almost every year, all named NP (for North Pole). Drifting stations monitor the ice pack, temperature, sea depth, currents, weather conditions, and marine biology of the North Pole. As their name implies, drifting stations move with the drifting ice pack in the Arctic Ocean. They usually last two or three years before before the warmer climate of the Greenland Sea breaks up the ice floe . North Pole drifting stations are responsible for many discoveries about the ecosystem at the North Pole. In 1948, for example, bathymetry studies revealed the massive Lomonosov Ridge. The Lomonosov Ridge is an underwater mountain chain stretching across the North Pole, from the Siberian region of Russia all the way to Ellesmere Island, Canada. Drifting stations have recorded the development of cyclones in the Arctic, as well Arctic shrinkage . Arctic shrinkage is climate change in the Arctic, including warming temperatures, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet (resulting in more freshwater in the marine environment), and a loss of sea ice. Ecosystems at the North Pole Polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ), Arctic foxes ( Vulpes lagopus ), and other terrestrial animals rarely migrate to the North Pole. The drifting ice is an unpredictable habitat, and does not allow for regular migration routes or the establishment of dens in which to raise young. Still, polar bears sometimes wander into the area in search of food. The undersea ecosystem of the North Pole is more varied than the ice above it. Shrimp, sea anemones, and tiny crustaceans inhabit in the area. A few ringed seals ( Pusa hispida ) have been spotted. (Ringed seals are common prey of the polar bears that wander into the region.) Larger marine mammals , such as narwhals ( Monodon monoceros ), are much more rare. Several species of fish live at the North Pole. Arctic cod are the most abundant. Arctic cod ( Boreogadus saida ) are small fish usually found near the seafloor , close to their food sources—tiny shrimp and crustaceans. Birds are frequent visitors to the North Pole. The Arctic tern ( Sterna paradisaea ), which has the longest annual migration of any species on the planet, spends its spring and summer in the Arctic, though rarely as far north as the North Pole. It then flies 30,000 kilometers (18,641 miles) south, to the Antarctic Circle. The Arctic tern makes an Arctic-Antarctic round-trip migration every year. Like the Arctic tern, all other birds spotted near the North Pole are migratory. They include the small snow bunting ( Plectrophenax nivalis ) and gull-like fulmars and kittiwakes. Exploration Major polar exploration by non-Indigenous people began in the 19th century. The first expedition specifically to reach the North Pole was led by British Admiral William Edward Parry in 1827. Norwegian explorers Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen attempted a land-based expedition in 1895. A Swedish expedition led by Salomon August Andree tried to fly over the North Pole in a hydrogen balloon two years later. The first person to claim reaching the North Pole was American explorer Frederick Albert Cook , in 1908. Cook was unable to provide any navigational records of his achievement, however, and rest of his team later reported that they did not quite reach the pole. The claim remains controversial. A year later, another American explorer, Robert Peary , claimed to reach the North Pole. Peary was supported and funded by the National Geographic Society , which verified his claim. It has been in dispute ever since. Although Peary's North Pole team included four other people, none of them were trained in navigation. They were therefore unable to verify Peary's claims, and one of them, Matthew Henson, reported a conflicting route from Peary. Peary himself never made his navigational records available for review. Skeptics have noted the remarkable speed with which the expedition traveled once Capt. Bob Bartlett, the only other navigator, left the crew. Peary reported more than doubling the amount of territory covered daily as soon as Bartlett left the expedition. Nonetheless, many explorers support Peary's claims. National Geographic conducted extensive studies of the photographs Peary took, and concluded they were taken within eight kilometers (five miles) of the pole. (The photographs themselves have never been made public.) Depth soundings taken by Peary and Henson also seem to support their claim to have reached the pole. Perhaps the most important support for Peary's claim came from British explorer Tom Avery's polar expedition of 2005. Avery mimicked Peary's supposed route, using sled dog teams. The expedition successfully reached the North Pole. The first verified expedition to the North Pole was conducted by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen in 1926. Amundsen did not use a ship or dogsleds—he flew over the pole on the airship Norge . The Norge , lifted by hydrogen and powered by a diesel engine, flew over the North Pole on its route from the Norwegian Arctic to the U.S. state of Alaska. The first people verified to have set foot at the North Pole were a research group of geologists and oceanographers from the Soviet Union in 1948. The scientists were flown in and out of the pole over a three-day period. The first watercraft to reach the North Pole was a nuclear-powered submarine , the USS Nautilis , in 1958. Another U.S. submarine, the USS Skate , broke through the sea ice to surface near the North Pole about a year later. The first verified expeditions to reach the North Pole by foot didn't happen until the late 1960s. A team led by American explorer Ralph Plaisted used snowmobiles to reach the pole in 1968. A year later, an expedition led by British explorer Wally Herbert reached the pole on foot, with the aid of dogsleds and airlifted (flown-in) supplies. In 1986, 77 years after Robert Peary made his claim, a team led by National Geographic Explorer Emeritus Will Steger became the first verified expedition to reach the North Pole by dogsled without resupply. Shipping through the North Pole Today, large, powerful ships called icebreakers are often used to navigate the ocean around the North Pole. Icebreakers carve through the sea ice to make way for cargo and military ships. Icebreakers have very strong steel bows that can break through ice at a rate of about 10-20 knots (19-37 kilometers per hour, or 12-23 miles per hour). Until the 1990s, all icebreakers that traversed the North Pole were nuclear-powered. Arctic shrinking and the reduction of sea ice have since allowed diesel-powered icebreakers to navigate the North Pole. Fewer icebreakers may be needed in the future. Due to Arctic shrinkage, North Pole may be ice-free in the summer months by 2035. Cargo ships traveling between Asia, North America, and Europe save money by navigating the so-called Northern Sea Route, a trade route which often includes the North Pole. Ships carrying cargo such as oil, natural gas, minerals, and grain regularly use the Northern Sea Route. This saves companies hundreds of thousands of dollars by avoiding the long trip to and through the Panama Canal . Resources and Territorial Claims No one actually lives at the North Pole. Inuit people, who live in the nearby Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland, and Russia, have never made homes at the North Pole. The ice is constantly moving, making it nearly impossible to establish a permanent community. The Arctic Council, composed of nations with territory in the Arctic Circle, addresses issues faced by nations and indigenous people of the Arctic, including the North Pole. Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States are members of the Arctic Council. The possibility of an ice-free trade route between Europe, North America, and Asia makes the North Pole an economically valuable territory. Oil and gas exploration have proved lucrative in other parts of the Arctic, and the possibility of extractive activity around the North Pole's seabed interests many businesses, scientists, and engineers. However, taking advantage of sea routes or resources at the North Pole is politically delicate. The North Pole is in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, outside the territorial claims of any nation. However, international laws allowing nations to claim land extending along their continental shelf are currently being explored. Russia, Canada, Denmark (via its autonomous territory of Greenland), and Norway have all claimed areas extending from their continental shelves, with Canada and Russia voicing the strongest claims. In 2007, a Russian research expedition using sophisticated submersibles became the first to descend to the actual seabed beneath the North Pole. The expedition, Arktika , planted a titanium Russian flag on the spot. Other Arctic nations reacted strongly. The United States issued a statement dismissing any Russian claim to the region. Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs used a line from the Canadian national anthem in a rebuke: This is the true north strong and free, and they're fooling themselves if they think dropping a flag on the ocean floor is going to change anything. Russian leaders acknowledged Arktika was an expedition to prepare evidence supporting the North Pole as part of the Lomonosov Ridge—an extension of the continental shelf off Russia. However, expedition leaders questioned other Arctic nations' reaction. When pioneers reach a point hitherto unexplored by anybody, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs said, it is customary to leave flags there. Such was the case on the Moon, by the way. Fast Fact Flight Time Airlines flying from North America and Europe to Asia can save time and costly fuel by flying over the North Pole instead of in a straight line around the widening globe. This only became possible after Russia allowed commercial airliners to fly over Siberia in the early 1990s. Fast Fact H0H 0H0 That's the Canadian postal code for the North Pole, a reference to the area's most famous mythical resident, Santa Claus. Fast Fact North Pole, Alaska North Pole is a town in the central part of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is actually nowhere near the real North Pole, which is in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. Fast Fact No Time at the Poles Time is calculated using longitude. For instance, when the sun seems directly overhead, the local time is about noon. However, all lines of longitude meet at the poles, and the sun is only overhead twice a year (at the equinoxes.) For this reason, scientists and explorers at the poles record time-related data using whatever time zone they want. Fast Fact Wobbly Definition Earth's axis wobbles slightly. This causes the exact location of the North Polethe intersection of the axis and Earth's surface to wobble along with it. The precise location of the intersection at any given moment is called the instantaneous pole. Mathematicians have calculated the wobble, called polar motion, to about nine meters (30 feet) over about seven years. The phenomenon is called the Chandler wobble.

        "html_text": "National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Thursday, December 20, 2018 Around this time of year, we hear a lot about Santa and his elves working hard at the North Pole to make sure all the toys are ready for Christmas. However, we don’t always hear a lot about the place where all the magic happens. Here are just a few fun, scientific facts you should know about the North Pole: Two satellites in the Joint Polar Satellite System constellation, (Suomi NPP), circle the Earth from pole-to-pole 14 times each day as the planet rotates on its axis. The two satellites are separated by 50 minutes, which allows researchers to see ice moving in the Arctic using looped imagery. These two views from NOAA-20 and Suomi NPP show young ice moving horizontally in the Chukchi Sea, which is located northwest of Alaska. This imagery was taken on Dec. 18, 2018, using the satellite's VIIRS instrument, which is particularly useful because the region is currently experiencing polar night. (Jorel Torres/CIRA) Unlike Antarctica, there's no land at the North Pole. Instead it's all ice that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean. Over the past four decades, scientists have seen a steep decline in both the amount and thickness of Arctic sea ice during the summer and winter months. Using the (ATMS) on-board NOAA-20 and Suomi NPP, researchers can monitor sea ice extent throughout the year even under cloudy skies, explained Mitch Goldberg, a JPSS program scientist. In addition, Goldberg said NOAA uses data from the microwave imager onboard the Japanese Space Agency's Global Change Observation Mission â€“ Climate (GCOM-C) satellite. Each year, data from these satellites help ice analysts estimate the total sea ice extent as well as differentiate between first-year and multi-year ice. Multi-year ice is thicker and has survived at least one melt season, whereas first-year ice is much thinner. Arctic sea ice usually reaches its minimum around mid-September each year. In 2018, the noted that the amount of multi-year ice remaining this summer was the . While the shrinking Arctic ice cap won’t contribute to sea level rise, it could influence normal weather patterns and the global climate, according to the . Sea ice acts like a mirror and helps reflect sunlight and heat back into the atmosphere. If that sea ice shrinks or disappears, more of that solar energy would be absorbed by the open ocean. Additional heat in the ocean will cause temperatures in the Arctic to rise further. Scientists are studying how warming in the Arctic is changing atmospheric pressure patterns, including the , which has implications for weather across the U.S. and the globe. As the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites fly over the Arctic, they collect valuable information about the ocean and atmosphere. By tracking clouds using Channel 15 of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( ) onboard each satellite, researchers can see how the clouds are moving, which helps to estimate wind speed and direction. “Those data are fed into numerical weather prediction models to help better forecast weather particularly out to 3 to 7 days,” Goldberg explained. Forecasters then have a better idea of how fast a weather system will travel. “So if there’s a polar vortex or a cold wave coming from Canada, then our satellites help to provide better predictions of those,” he added. Airlines rely on this type of information because, as Goldberg explained, “the wind speeds at the altitudes planes travel are very important.” From early October to early March, the North Pole experiences total darkness. So how do polar orbiting satellites still capture imagery of the Arctic during that period? Arron Layns, the JPSS algorithm management project lead, explained that the (DNB) is very sensitive to low levels of visible light at night. The DNB can see nighttime city lights, the light from a single ship at sea, auroras and even the glow of Earth’s atmosphere. This band is particularly useful for forecasters in Alaska because it allows them to see low-level clouds, sea ice and snow during the long nights of the Arctic winter. Did you know that using a compass won’t necessarily take you due north if you’re traveling to the North Pole? That’s because there’s a difference between the geographic North Pole and the geomagnetic North Pole, which is what compasses and that handy GPS app on your phone use. Geomagnetic poles change over time, so what was geomagnetic north 10 years ago isn’t the same as it is in 2018. In other words, trekking from Greenland to the North Pole isn’t the best idea if you’re relying solely on a compass. So, if you were planning on tracking down Santa this Christmas, maybe leave it to the experts at the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( ). They have been tracking Santa’s journey from the North Pole for more than 60 years! "

        "html_text": " Turns out there's more than one. Aric Jenkins is a journalist based in Brooklyn. Specializing in travel, tech, and culture, he was previously a staff writer at Fortune and Time . His work has also appeared in The New York Times , Travel + Leisure , Food & Wine , and more. Every Christmas, a slew of letters addressed to Santa make their way to the North Pole. But where exactly is the North Pole? Depending on your definition of it, there's more than one — the North Pole and the North Magnetic Pole. Here's everything you need to know about the fabled — but also very real — land, from Santa's workshop, to his address, and the country and continent it's on. Let's start with the North Pole you're probably thinking of: the Geographic North Pole, also known as the Terrestrial North Pole. This is literally the top of the Earth, the northernmost point on the planet, and the center of the Northern Hemisphere. If you look at a map of the North Pole, you'll notice that the point where it falls happens to be in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. So what continent is the North Pole on? Unlike its counterpart, Antarctica's South Pole, the Geographic North Pole is not situated on a landmass, though it's sometimes covered in a floating sheet of sea ice, depending on the seasonal temperature. With no land to be claimed, the North Pole and its surrounding high seas do not belong to any country. The same goes for the Geographic North Pole's cousin, the North Magnetic Pole, which is the point on Earth where the planet's magnetic field points directly downwards (imagine a needle on a compass). The North Magnetic Pole couldn't be claimed by a nation anyway because it shifts location over time due to magnetic changes in the Earth's core, but it generally resides in the Arctic Circle, not far from the Geographic North Pole. The Arctic region in general, however, is the subject of a between the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway, and Denmark, which owns the Arctic Circle-bordering Greenland, according to Bloomberg. As you can probably guess, it's cold. Temperatures in the summer can reach, on average, around 32 degrees Fahrenheit — the freezing point of water. By Christmas time, temperatures drop much lower to around negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit on average. The North Pole is a land of extremes. Because of the Earth's tilted axis as it revolves around the sun, sunlight is either constant or not present at all depending on the season, In the summer, the sun is always above the horizon at the North Pole, meaning it gets 24 hours of daylight. In the winter, the sun is always below the horizon, plunging the region into complete darkness for 24 hours. In fact, the North Pole only experiences one sunrise and sunset a year at the March equinox and September equinox, respectively, according to the magazine. The climate of the North Pole could be changing due to global warming, too, according to NASA scientists, Record temperatures and melting ice caps have led scientists to fear about the North Pole's ecosystem and its wildlife — as well as rising sea levels that could someday flood coastal cities. Of course he does — just not at the Geographic North Pole because the constantly shifting ice sheets make it difficult to operate a place that is supposed to supply all of the world's children with Christmas presents. Rather, Santa's workshop is situated at a different North Pole — North Pole, New York, a village within the town of Wilmington. Here, visitors can explore the Village of Lights, watch live performances of holiday-themed musicals, and even sit down for breakfast with Santa Claus himself. And as a fun fact, there's another North Pole in the U.S. that travelers can visit: North Pole, Alaska. While Santa hasn't made it the home of his workshop, the city is known for its year-round Christmas decorations and the Santa Claus House, a Christmas store brimming with children's letters to Santa along its wall. The streets even have names like Kris Kringle Drive and Mistletoe Lane. When you visit this site, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

        "html_text": " : The North Pole , also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole , is the point in the where the meets its surface. It is called the True North Pole to distinguish from the . The North Pole is by definition the northernmost point on the Earth, lying to the . It defines geodetic 90° North, as well as the direction of . At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. No time zone has been assigned to the North Pole, so any time can be used as the local time. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere. The nearest land is usually said to be , off the northern coast of about 700 km (430 mi) away, though some perhaps semi-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer. The nearest permanently inhabited place is in the , Nunavut, Canada, which is located 817 km (508 mi) from the Pole. While the South Pole lies on a continental , the North Pole is located in the middle of the amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting . The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at 4,261 m (13,980 ft) by the Russian in and at 4,087 m (13,409 ft) by in 1958. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole ( ). However, the , and later Russia, constructed a number of on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, a group of Russians have also annually established a private base, , close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring. Studies in the 2000s predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice-free because of , with timescales varying from 2016 to the late 21st century or later. Attempts to reach the North Pole began in the late 19th century, with the record for being surpassed on numerous occasions. The first undisputed expedition to reach the North Pole was that of the airship , which overflew the area in 1926 with 16 men on board, including expedition leader . Three prior expeditions – led by (1908, land), (1909, land) and (1926, aerial) – were once also accepted as having reached the Pole. However, in each case later analysis of expedition data has cast doubt upon the accuracy of their claims. The first confirmed overland expedition to reach the North Pole was in 1968 by , Walt Pederson, Gerry Pitzl and Jean-Luc Bombardier, using snowmobiles and with air support. The Earth's axis of rotation – and hence the position of the North Pole – was commonly believed to be fixed (relative to the surface of the Earth) until, in the 18th century, the mathematician predicted that the axis might wobble slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent variation of latitude, as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth's surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth's axis and the Earth's surface, at any given moment, is called the instantaneous pole, but because of the wobble this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required. It is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevations or ) to fixed landforms. However, given and , there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the and the have defined a framework called the . As early as the 16th century, many prominent people correctly believed that the North Pole was in a sea, which in the 19th century was called the or . It was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year. Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes. One of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer , who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. In 1871, the , a US attempt on the Pole led by , ended in disaster. Another British attempt to get to the pole, part of the , by Commander reached a then-record 83°20'26 North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879–1881 expedition commanded by officer ended tragically when their ship, the , was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including De Long, were lost. In April 1895, the Norwegian explorers and struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen's icebound ship . The pair reached latitude 86°14′ North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching . In 1897, Swedish engineer and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon Örnen (Eagle), but came down 300 km (190 mi) north of , the northeasternmost part of the archipelago. They trekked to Kvitøya but died there three months after their crash. In 1930 the remains of were found by the Norwegian . The Italian explorer and Captain of the (Regia Marina) sailed the converted whaler (Pole Star) from Norway in 1899. On 11 March 1900, Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86° 34’ on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen's result of 1895 by 35 to 40 km (22 to 25 mi). Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until 23 June. On 16 August, the Stella Polare left heading south and the expedition returned to Norway. The US explorer claimed to have reached the North Pole on 21 April 1908 with two men, Ahwelah and Etukishook, but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted. The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to US Navy engineer , who claimed to have reached the Pole on 6 April 1909, accompanied by and four Inuit men, Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Peary's claim remains highly disputed and controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole. The distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Peary's account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line – the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing – is contradicted by Henson's account of tortuous detours to avoid and . The British explorer , initially a supporter of Peary, researched Peary's records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer's navigational records. He concluded that Peary had not reached the Pole. Support for Peary came again in 2005, however, when British explorer and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey with replica wooden sleds and teams, reaching the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours – nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery's fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles (170 km), significantly short of the 135 nautical miles (250 km) claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from . Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole. The first claimed flight over the Pole was made on 9 May 1926 by US naval officer and pilot in a aircraft. Although verified at the time by a committee of the , this claim has since been undermined by the 1996 revelation that Byrd's long-hidden diary's solar data (which the NGS never checked) consistently contradict his June 1926 report's parallel data by over 100 mi (160 km). The secret report's alleged en-route solar sextant data were inadvertently so impossibly overprecise that he excised all these alleged raw solar observations out of the version of the report finally sent to geographical societies five months later (while the original version was hidden for 70 years), a realization first published in 2000 by the after scrupulous refereeing. The first consistent, verified, and scientifically convincing attainment of the Pole was on 12 May 1926, by Norwegian explorer and his US sponsor from the . Norge , though Norwegian-owned, was designed and piloted by the Italian . The flight started from in Norway, and crossed the Arctic Ocean to Alaska. Nobile, with several scientists and crew from the Norge , overflew the Pole a second time on 24 May 1928, in the airship . The Italia crashed on its return from the Pole, with the loss of half the crew. was accomplished in a Tupolev ANT-25 airplane with a crew of , and , who flew over the North Pole on 19 June 1937, during their direct flight from the Soviet Union to the USA without any stopover. In May 1937 the world's first , , was established by Soviet scientists 20 kilometres (13 mi) from the North Pole after the ever first landing of four heavy and one light aircraft onto the ice at the North Pole. The expedition members — oceanographer , meteorologist , radio operator , and the leader — conducted scientific research at the station for the next nine months. By 19 February 1938, when the group was picked up by the ice breakers and Murman , their station had drifted 2850 km to the eastern coast of Greenland. In May 1945 an of the Aries expedition became the first aircraft to overfly the North Geographic and North Magnetic Poles. The plane was piloted by David Cecil McKinley of the . It carried an 11-man crew, with Kenneth C. Maclure of the in charge of all scientific observations. In 2006, Maclure was honoured with a spot in . Discounting Peary's disputed claim, the first men to set foot at the North Pole were a Soviet party including geophysicists Mikhail Ostrekin and Pavel Senko, oceanographers Mikhail Somov and Pavel Gordienko, and other scientists and flight crew (24 people in total) of 's Sever-2 expedition (March–May 1948). It was organized by the . The party flew on three planes (pilots Ivan Cherevichnyy, Vitaly Maslennikov and Ilya Kotov) from to the North Pole and landed there at 4:44pm ( , ) on 23 April 1948. They established a temporary camp and for the next two days conducted scientific observations. On 26 April the expedition flew back to the continent. Next year, on 9 May 1949 two other Soviet scientists (Vitali Volovich and Andrei Medvedev) became the first people to parachute onto the North Pole. They jumped from a , registered CCCP H-369. On 3 May 1952, Lieutenant Colonel and Lieutenant , along with scientist , landed a modified at the North Pole. Some Western sources considered this to be the first landing at the Pole until the Soviet landings became widely known. The United States Navy submarine (SSN-571) crossed the North Pole on 3 August 1958. On 17 March 1959 (SSN-578) surfaced at the Pole, breaking through the ice above it, becoming the first naval vessel to do so. The first confirmed surface conquest of the North Pole was accomplished by , Walt Pederson, Gerry Pitzl and Jean Luc Bombardier, who traveled over the ice by and arrived on 19 April 1968. The United States Air Force independently confirmed their position. On 6 April 1969 and companions Allan Gill, and Kenneth Hedges of the British Trans-Arctic Expedition became the first men to reach the North Pole on foot (albeit with the aid of and ). They continued on to complete the first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean – and by its longest axis, , to – a feat that has never been repeated. Because of suggestions (later proven false) of Plaisted's use of air transport, some sources classify Herbert's expedition as the first confirmed to reach the North Pole over the ice surface by any means. In the 1980s Plaisted's pilots and Ken Lee signed affidavits asserting that no such airlift was provided. It is also said that Herbert was the first person to reach the . On 17 August 1977 the Soviet completed the first surface vessel journey to the North Pole. In 1982 and became the first people to cross the Arctic Ocean in a single season. They departed from Cape Crozier, , on 17 February 1982 and arrived at the geographic North Pole on 10 April 1982. They travelled on foot and snowmobile. From the Pole, they travelled towards Svalbard but, due to the unstable nature of the ice, ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days. They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship MV Benjamin Bowring and boarded it on 4 August 1982 at position 80:31N 00:59W. As a result of this journey, which formed a section of the three-year 1979–1982, Fiennes and Burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles, by surface travel alone. This achievement remains unchallenged to this day. The expedition crew included a named who became the first dog to visit both poles. In 1985 (the first man to stand on the summit of Mount Everest) and (the first man to stand on the moon) landed at the North Pole in a small twin-engined ski plane. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest. In 1986 , with seven teammates, became the first to be confirmed as reaching the Pole by dogsled and without resupply. operated in the Arctic Ocean under the polar ice cap from September to November 1984 in company with one of her sister ships, the attack submarine . On 12 November 1984 Gurnard and Pintado became the third pair of submarines to surface together at the North Pole. In March 1990, Gurnard deployed to the Arctic region during exercise Ice Ex '90 and completed only the fourth winter submerged transit of the Bering and Seas. Gurnard surfaced at the North Pole on 18 April, in the company of the . On 6 May 1986 , and surfaced at the North Pole, the first tri-submarine surfacing at the North Pole. On 21 April 1987 of Japan became the first person to reach the North Pole on a . On 18 May 1987 , and surfaced at the North Pole, the first international surfacing at the North Pole. In 1988 a team of 13 (9 Soviets, 4 Canadians) from Siberia to northern Canada. One of the Canadians, , became the first person to reach the Pole from both sides of the Arctic Ocean. On April 16, 1990, a German-Swiss expedition led by a team of the reached the Geographic North Pole for studies on pollution of , snow and air. Samples taken were analyzed in cooperation with the and the . Further stops for sample collections were on multi-year at 86°N, at and . On 4 May 1990 and became the first explorers ever to reach the North Pole unsupported, after a 58-day ski trek from Ellesmere Island in Canada, a distance of 800 km. On 7 September 1991 the German research vessel and the Swedish reached the North Pole as the first conventional powered vessels. Both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common and a game on an ice floe. Polarstern again reached the pole exactly 10 years later, with the . In 1998, 1999, and 2000, Marshs (special very large wheeled versions made by BRONTO, Lada/Vaz's experimental product division) were driven to the North Pole. The 1998 expedition was dropped by parachute and completed the track to the North Pole. The 2000 expedition departed from a Russian research base around 114 km from the Pole and claimed an average speed of 20–15 km/h in an average temperature of −30 °C. Commercial airliner flights on the may pass within viewing distance of the North Pole. For example, a flight from to may come close as latitude 89° N, though because of prevailing winds return journeys go over the . In recent years journeys to the North Pole by air (landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice) or by icebreaker have become relatively routine, and are even available to small groups of tourists through companies. Parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the North Pole in recent years. The temporary seasonal Russian camp of has been established by air a short distance from the Pole annually since 2002, and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties. Trips from the camp to the Pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter. The first attempt at exploration of the North Pole was made on 22 April 1998 by Russian firefighter and diver Andrei Rozhkov with the support of the Diving Club of , but ended in fatality. The next attempted dive at the North Pole was organized the next year by the same diving club, and ended in success on 24 April 1999. The divers were Michael Wolff (Austria), Brett Cormick (UK), and Bob Wass (USA). In 2005 the United States Navy submarine (SSN-766) surfaced through 155 cm (61 in) of ice at the North Pole and spent 18 hours there. In July 2007 British endurance swimmer completed a 1 km (0.62 mi) swim at the North Pole. His feat, undertaken to highlight the , took place in clear water that had opened up between the ice floes. His later attempt to paddle a to the North Pole in late 2008, following the erroneous prediction of clear water to the Pole, was stymied when his expedition found itself stuck in thick ice after only three days. The expedition was then abandoned. By September 2007 the North Pole had been visited 66 times by different surface ships: 54 times by Soviet and Russian icebreakers, 4 times by Swedish Oden , 3 times by German , 3 times by and , and once by and by Swedish . On 2 August 2007 a Russian scientific expedition made the first ever manned descent to the ocean floor at the North Pole, to a depth of 4.3 km (2.7 mi), as part of the research programme in support of Russia's to a large swathe of the Arctic Ocean floor. The descent took place in two and was led by Soviet and Russian polar explorer . In a symbolic act of visitation, the was placed on the ocean floor exactly at the Pole. The expedition was the latest in a series of efforts intended to give Russia a dominant influence in the according to . The warming and summer shrinkage of the iced area has attracted the attention of many countries, such as China and the United States, toward the top of the world, where resources and shipping routes may soon be exploitable. In 2009 the Russian with as a leader and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Sergey Larin, Alexey Ushakov and Nikolay Nikulshin reached the North Pole on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs. The vehicles, Yemelya-1 and Yemelya-2, were designed by Vasily Elagin, a Russian mountain climber, explorer and engineer. They reached the North Pole on 26 April 2009, 17:30 (Moscow time). The expedition was partly supported by Russian State Aviation. The Russian Book of Records recognized it as the first successful vehicle trip from land to the Geographical North Pole. On 1 March 2013 the Russian Marine Live-Ice Automobile Expedition (MLAE 2013) with Vasily Elagin as a leader, and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Andrey Vankov, Sergey Isayev and Nikolay Kozlov on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs—Yemelya-3 and Yemelya-4—started from Golomyanny Island (the Archipelago) to the North Pole across drifting ice of the Arctic Ocean. The vehicles reached the Pole on 6 April and then continued to the Canadian coast. The coast was reached on 30 April 2013 (83°08N, 075°59W ), and on 5 May 2013 the expedition finished in , NU. The way between the Russian borderland (Machtovyi Island of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, 80°15N, 097°27E) and the Canadian coast (Ward Hunt Island, 83°08N, 075°59W) took 55 days; it was ~2300 km across drifting ice and about 4000 km in total. The expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies. The expedition was supported by the . The sun at the North Pole is continuously during the summer and continuously during the winter. is just before the (around 20 March); the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23½° elevation at the summer (around 21 June), after which time it begins to sink, reaching just after the (around 23 September). When the sun is visible in the polar sky, it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon. This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox. Hence the North and South Poles experience the slowest rates of sunrise and sunset on Earth. The period that occurs before sunrise and after sunset has three different definitions: These effects are caused by a combination of the Earth's and its revolution around the sun. The direction of the Earth's axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods). At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference. In most places on Earth, local time is determined by , such that the time of day is more or less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday, the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole and no particular time zone has been assigned. Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient, such as , or the time zone of the country from which they departed. The North Pole is substantially warmer than the because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat), rather than at altitude on a continental land mass. Despite being an ice cap, the northernmost weather station in Greenland has a tundra climate (Köppen ET ) due to the July and August mean temperatures peaking just above freezing. Winter temperatures at the in Greenland can range from about −50 to −13 °C (−58 to 9 °F), averaging around −31 °C (−24 °F), with the North Pole being slightly colder. However, a freak storm caused the temperature to reach 0.7 °C (33.3 °F) for a time at a buoy, located at 87.45°N, on 30 December 2015. It was estimated that the temperature at the North Pole was between −1 and 2 °C (30 and 35 °F) during the storm. Summer temperatures (June, July, and August) average around the freezing point (0 °C (32 °F)). The highest temperature yet recorded is 13 °C (55 °F), much warmer than the South Pole's record high of only −12.3 °C (9.9 °F). A similar spike in temperatures occurred on 15 November 2016 when temperatures hit freezing. Yet again, February 2018 featured a storm so powerful that temperatures at Cape Morris Jesup, the world's northernmost weather station in Greenland, reached 6.1 °C (43.0 °F) and spent 24 straight hours above freezing. Meanwhile, the pole itself was estimated to reach a high temperature of 1.6 °C (34.9 °F) . This same temperature of 1.6 °C (34.9 °F) was also recorded at the in at the very same time. The sea ice at the North Pole is typically around 2 to 3 m (6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in) thick, although ice thickness, its spatial extent, and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate. Studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years. It is likely that has contributed to this, but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the Arctic. Reports have also predicted that within a few decades the Arctic Ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer. This may have significant commercial implications; see Territorial claims, below. The retreat of the Arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming, as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation, and may have serious climate implications by contributing to Arctic cyclone generation. are believed to travel rarely beyond about 82° North, owing to the scarcity of food, though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the North Pole, and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just 1 mi (1.6 km) from the Pole. The has also been seen at the Pole, and have been observed less than 60 km (37 mi) away at 89°40′ N. Birds seen at or very near the Pole include the , and , though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions. Fish have been seen in the waters at the North Pole, but these are probably few in number. A member of the Russian team that descended to the North Pole seabed in August 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there. However, it was later reported that a had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the Russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified and . Currently, under , no country owns the North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The five surrounding Arctic countries, Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark (via Greenland), and the United States, are limited to a 200- (370 km; 230 mi) off their coasts, and the area beyond that is administered by the . Upon ratification of the , a country has 10 years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. If validated, such a claim gives the claimant state rights to what may be on or beneath the sea bottom within the claimed zone. Norway (ratified the convention in 1996 ), Russia (ratified in 1997 ), Canada (ratified in 2003 ) and Denmark (ratified in 2004 ) have all launched projects to base claims that certain areas of Arctic continental shelves should be subject to their sole sovereign exploitation. In 1907 Canada invoked a sector principle to claim sovereignty over a sector stretching from its coasts to the North Pole. This claim has not been relinquished, but was not consistently pressed until 2013. In some children's and , the geographic North Pole is described as the location of , although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic North Pole. has assigned postal code to the North Pole (referring to Santa's traditional exclamation of !). This association reflects an age-old esoteric mythology of that posits the North Pole, the otherworldly world-axis, as the abode of God and superhuman beings. As has documented, the North Pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of and Iranian mysticism. The Orient sought by the mystic, the Orient that cannot be located on our maps, is in the direction of the north, beyond the north.. In , the North Pole and are considered to be auspicious, since they are associated with the . face north when praying, and are also oriented towards the north. On the contrary, South is associated with the . Owing to its remoteness, the Pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient tradition called (Jabal Qaf), the farthest point of the earth. According to certain authors, the Jabal Qaf of is a version of , a mountain whose ascent, like climbing of the , represents the pilgrim's progress through spiritual states. In Iranian theosophy, the heavenly Pole, the focal point of the spiritual ascent, acts as a magnet to draw beings to its palaces ablaze with immaterial matter. "

        "html_text": "Scientists are very interested in the North Pole—the northernmost point on Earth 9 - 12+ Biology, Ecology, Earth Science, Geology, Geography, Physical Geography, Social Studies, World History The North Pole is the northernmost point on Earth. It is the precise point of the intersection of Earth's axis and Earth's surface. From the North Pole, all directions are south. Its latitude is 90 degrees north, and all lines of longitude meet there (as well as at the South Pole, on the opposite end of Earth). Polaris , the current North Star, sits almost motionless in the sky above the pole, making it an excellent fixed point to use in celestial navigation in the Northern Hemisphere. The North Pole sits in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, on water that is almost always covered with ice . The ice is about two to three meters (six to 10 feet) thick. The depth of the ocean at the North Pole is more than 4,000 meters (13,123 feet). The Canadian territory of Nunavut lies closest to the North Pole. Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous teterritory within the Kingdom of Denmark, is also close to the pole. The North Pole is much warmer than the South Pole. This is because sits at a lower elevation ( sea level ) and is located in the middle of an ocean, which is warmer than the ice-covered continent of Antarctica. But it's not exactly beach weather . In the summer, the warmest time of year, the temperature is right at the freezing point: 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit.) Because Earth rotates on a tilted axis as it revolves around the sun, sunlight is experienced in extremes at the poles. In fact, the North Pole experiences only one sunrise (at the March equinox ) and one sunset (at the September equinox) every year. From the North Pole, the sun is always above the horizon in the summer and below the horizon in the winter. This means the region experiences up to 24 hours of sunlight in the summer and 24 hours of darkness in the winter. Drifting Research Stations Since the North Pole sits on drifting ice, it's difficult and expensive for scientists and explorers to study. There isn’t land or a place for permanent facilities, making it difficult to set up equipment. The most consistent research of the North Pole has come from manned drifting research stations. Russia sends out a drifting station almost every year, all named NP (for North Pole). Drifting stations monitor the ice pack, temperature, sea depth, currents, weather conditions, and marine biology of the North Pole. As their name implies, drifting stations move with the drifting ice pack in the Arctic Ocean. They usually last two or three years before before the warmer climate of the Greenland Sea breaks up the ice floe . North Pole drifting stations are responsible for many discoveries about the ecosystem at the North Pole. In 1948, for example, bathymetry studies revealed the massive Lomonosov Ridge. The Lomonosov Ridge is an underwater mountain chain stretching across the North Pole, from the Siberian region of Russia all the way to Ellesmere Island, Canada. Drifting stations have recorded the development of cyclones in the Arctic, as well Arctic shrinkage . Arctic shrinkage is climate change in the Arctic, including warming temperatures, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet (resulting in more freshwater in the marine environment), and a loss of sea ice. Ecosystems at the North Pole Polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ), Arctic foxes ( Vulpes lagopus ), and other terrestrial animals rarely migrate to the North Pole. The drifting ice is an unpredictable habitat, and does not allow for regular migration routes or the establishment of dens in which to raise young. Still, polar bears sometimes wander into the area in search of food. The undersea ecosystem of the North Pole is more varied than the ice above it. Shrimp, sea anemones, and tiny crustaceans inhabit in the area. A few ringed seals ( Pusa hispida ) have been spotted. (Ringed seals are common prey of the polar bears that wander into the region.) Larger marine mammals , such as narwhals ( Monodon monoceros ), are much more rare. Several species of fish live at the North Pole. Arctic cod are the most abundant. Arctic cod ( Boreogadus saida ) are small fish usually found near the seafloor , close to their food sources—tiny shrimp and crustaceans. Birds are frequent visitors to the North Pole. The Arctic tern ( Sterna paradisaea ), which has the longest annual migration of any species on the planet, spends its spring and summer in the Arctic, though rarely as far north as the North Pole. It then flies 30,000 kilometers (18,641 miles) south, to the Antarctic Circle. The Arctic tern makes an Arctic-Antarctic round-trip migration every year. Like the Arctic tern, all other birds spotted near the North Pole are migratory. They include the small snow bunting ( Plectrophenax nivalis ) and gull-like fulmars and kittiwakes. Exploration Major polar exploration by non-Indigenous people began in the 19th century. The first expedition specifically to reach the North Pole was led by British Admiral William Edward Parry in 1827. Norwegian explorers Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen attempted a land-based expedition in 1895. A Swedish expedition led by Salomon August Andree tried to fly over the North Pole in a hydrogen balloon two years later. The first person to claim reaching the North Pole was American explorer Frederick Albert Cook , in 1908. Cook was unable to provide any navigational records of his achievement, however, and rest of his team later reported that they did not quite reach the pole. The claim remains controversial. A year later, another American explorer, Robert Peary , claimed to reach the North Pole. Peary was supported and funded by the National Geographic Society , which verified his claim. It has been in dispute ever since. Although Peary's North Pole team included four other people, none of them were trained in navigation. They were therefore unable to verify Peary's claims, and one of them, Matthew Henson, reported a conflicting route from Peary. Peary himself never made his navigational records available for review. Skeptics have noted the remarkable speed with which the expedition traveled once Capt. Bob Bartlett, the only other navigator, left the crew. Peary reported more than doubling the amount of territory covered daily as soon as Bartlett left the expedition. Nonetheless, many explorers support Peary's claims. National Geographic conducted extensive studies of the photographs Peary took, and concluded they were taken within eight kilometers (five miles) of the pole. (The photographs themselves have never been made public.) Depth soundings taken by Peary and Henson also seem to support their claim to have reached the pole. Perhaps the most important support for Peary's claim came from British explorer Tom Avery's polar expedition of 2005. Avery mimicked Peary's supposed route, using sled dog teams. The expedition successfully reached the North Pole. The first verified expedition to the North Pole was conducted by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen in 1926. Amundsen did not use a ship or dogsleds—he flew over the pole on the airship Norge . The Norge , lifted by hydrogen and powered by a diesel engine, flew over the North Pole on its route from the Norwegian Arctic to the U.S. state of Alaska. The first people verified to have set foot at the North Pole were a research group of geologists and oceanographers from the Soviet Union in 1948. The scientists were flown in and out of the pole over a three-day period. The first watercraft to reach the North Pole was a nuclear-powered submarine , the USS Nautilis , in 1958. Another U.S. submarine, the USS Skate , broke through the sea ice to surface near the North Pole about a year later. The first verified expeditions to reach the North Pole by foot didn't happen until the late 1960s. A team led by American explorer Ralph Plaisted used snowmobiles to reach the pole in 1968. A year later, an expedition led by British explorer Wally Herbert reached the pole on foot, with the aid of dogsleds and airlifted (flown-in) supplies. In 1986, 77 years after Robert Peary made his claim, a team led by National Geographic Explorer Emeritus Will Steger became the first verified expedition to reach the North Pole by dogsled without resupply. Shipping through the North Pole Today, large, powerful ships called icebreakers are often used to navigate the ocean around the North Pole. Icebreakers carve through the sea ice to make way for cargo and military ships. Icebreakers have very strong steel bows that can break through ice at a rate of about 10-20 knots (19-37 kilometers per hour, or 12-23 miles per hour). Until the 1990s, all icebreakers that traversed the North Pole were nuclear-powered. Arctic shrinking and the reduction of sea ice have since allowed diesel-powered icebreakers to navigate the North Pole. Fewer icebreakers may be needed in the future. Due to Arctic shrinkage, North Pole may be ice-free in the summer months by 2035. Cargo ships traveling between Asia, North America, and Europe save money by navigating the so-called Northern Sea Route, a trade route which often includes the North Pole. Ships carrying cargo such as oil, natural gas, minerals, and grain regularly use the Northern Sea Route. This saves companies hundreds of thousands of dollars by avoiding the long trip to and through the Panama Canal . Resources and Territorial Claims No one actually lives at the North Pole. Inuit people, who live in the nearby Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland, and Russia, have never made homes at the North Pole. The ice is constantly moving, making it nearly impossible to establish a permanent community. The Arctic Council, composed of nations with territory in the Arctic Circle, addresses issues faced by nations and indigenous people of the Arctic, including the North Pole. Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States are members of the Arctic Council. The possibility of an ice-free trade route between Europe, North America, and Asia makes the North Pole an economically valuable territory. Oil and gas exploration have proved lucrative in other parts of the Arctic, and the possibility of extractive activity around the North Pole's seabed interests many businesses, scientists, and engineers. However, taking advantage of sea routes or resources at the North Pole is politically delicate. The North Pole is in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, outside the territorial claims of any nation. However, international laws allowing nations to claim land extending along their continental shelf are currently being explored. Russia, Canada, Denmark (via its autonomous territory of Greenland), and Norway have all claimed areas extending from their continental shelves, with Canada and Russia voicing the strongest claims. In 2007, a Russian research expedition using sophisticated submersibles became the first to descend to the actual seabed beneath the North Pole. The expedition, Arktika , planted a titanium Russian flag on the spot. Other Arctic nations reacted strongly. The United States issued a statement dismissing any Russian claim to the region. Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs used a line from the Canadian national anthem in a rebuke: This is the true north strong and free, and they're fooling themselves if they think dropping a flag on the ocean floor is going to change anything. Russian leaders acknowledged Arktika was an expedition to prepare evidence supporting the North Pole as part of the Lomonosov Ridge—an extension of the continental shelf off Russia. However, expedition leaders questioned other Arctic nations' reaction. When pioneers reach a point hitherto unexplored by anybody, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs said, it is customary to leave flags there. Such was the case on the Moon, by the way. Fast Fact Flight Time Airlines flying from North America and Europe to Asia can save time and costly fuel by flying over the North Pole instead of in a straight line around the widening globe. This only became possible after Russia allowed commercial airliners to fly over Siberia in the early 1990s. Fast Fact H0H 0H0 That's the Canadian postal code for the North Pole, a reference to the area's most famous mythical resident, Santa Claus. Fast Fact North Pole, Alaska North Pole is a town in the central part of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is actually nowhere near the real North Pole, which is in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. Fast Fact No Time at the Poles Time is calculated using longitude. For instance, when the sun seems directly overhead, the local time is about noon. However, all lines of longitude meet at the poles, and the sun is only overhead twice a year (at the equinoxes.) For this reason, scientists and explorers at the poles record time-related data using whatever time zone they want. Fast Fact Wobbly Definition Earth's axis wobbles slightly. This causes the exact location of the North Polethe intersection of the axis and Earth's surface to wobble along with it. The precise location of the intersection at any given moment is called the instantaneous pole. Mathematicians have calculated the wobble, called polar motion, to about nine meters (30 feet) over about seven years. The phenomenon is called the Chandler wobble.

        "html_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. . The North Pole has multiple meanings; it can indicate the geographically northernmost point on Earth or to the spot where compasses point. And, most enchantingly, it can refer to Santa's headquarters. The North Pole has inspired human imagination, scientific exploration and political conflict for decades. The Geographic North Pole is the northernmost point on the planet, where Earth's axis intersects with its surface. Its latitude is 90 degrees north, and all longitudinal lines meet there. From there, every direction one turns is south. Because all longitudinal lines begin from it, the North Pole has no time zone. The pole is surrounded by the Arctic Ocean, where the water is 13,400 feet (4,084 meters) deep and usually covered with drifting 6-to-10 feet (1.8 to 3 m) thick. About 434 light-years above the pole lies During the course of the night, Polaris does not rise or set, but remains in very nearly the same spot above the northern axis year-round while the other stars circle around it. The star has been an important marker for navigation for centuries. Over time, the location of the North Pole changes slightly. Earth's has a slight wobble, and since the pole intersects with the axis, it wobbles along with it. Scientists have calculated that the pole wobbles about 30 feet over seven years. The precise point of the pole at any given moment is known as the instantaneous pole. In recent years, scientists have noticed that the axis is drifting rapidly eastward because of climate change. Since 2000, the (opens in new tab) by about 75 degrees, heading toward the Prime Meridian that runs through Greenwich, England, according to Surendra Adhikari, an Earth scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Adhikari said in a 2016 National Geographic article that the axis has shifted about 10 centimeters (4 inches) per year. Scientists suspect that rapidly melting ice sheets have caused a redistribution of mass. by adding water to the oceans and lightening the load on ice-covered crust, according to a 2005 Live Science article. The Magnetic North Pole is not the same as true north; it is several hundreds of miles south of the Geographic North Pole. Earth's iron core and movement within its outer part generates a , and the magnetic North and South poles are where the field is vertical. point to the magnetic North Pole. However, what we call the Magnetic North Pole is actually a south magnetic pole. Magnetic field sources are dipolar, having a north and south magnetic pole. Opposite poles (N and S) attract, and like poles (N and N, or S and S) repel, according to Joseph Becker of San Jose State University. This creates a toroidal, or , as the direction of the field propagates outward from the north pole and enters through the south pole. In other words, the north pole of one magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet. Because Earth's Magnetic North Pole attracts the north ends of other magnets, it is technically the south pole of the planet's magnetic field. The magnetic poles and the geographic poles don't line up, and the difference between them is called declination. Since its discovery in 1831, the Magnetic North Pole has been around Canada's Ellesmere Island, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) from the Geographic North Pole. But the magnetic field drifts, causing the angle of declination to change over time. Currently, the Magnetic North Pole moves about 25 miles (40 km) each year in a northwest direction — at a faster rate than it has moved since tracking began in the 1830s. The change could cause problems for migrating birds and human . Eventually, the magnetic North and South poles will move to the point that they flip and compasses would point south. This change will happen slowly and not in our lifetimes. The last flip occurred 730,000 years ago. Because of Earth's tilted axis, the North Pole experiences only one sunrise and one sunset every year, at the March and September , respectively. During the summer, there is sunlight all day; during the winter, it is always dark. During the winter, the Geographic North Pole's annual mean temperature is minus 40 Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius). In the summer, it is 32 F (0 C). Though it is by no means warm, it is considerably warmer than in the land-based in Antarctica, because the North Pole is over water. Research stations have reported cyclones at the North Pole and, in recent years, ice and , which is part of Arctic climate change. Scientists predict that ships will be able to sail directly over the North Pole by the year 2050. In fact, the Arctic ice sheet will be thin enough for ice breakers to carve a straight path between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, according to a by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Another found that by the end of the 21st century, the Northern Sea Route could be navigable for more than half the year. In particular, the Arctic has experienced major ice decline within the last decade. So what is happening? Typically, the ice follows a seasonal cycle. For example, in the spring and summer months, the warmer temperatures cause the ice floating on top of the Arctic Ocean to shrink. Then as the temperatures drop in the fall and winter months, the ice cover grows again until it reaches its yearly maximum extent, typically in March. In 2017, however, a combination of warmer-than-average temperatures, winds unfavorable to ice expansion, and a series of storms halted sea ice growth in the Arctic. In fact,on March 7, 2017, Arctic sea ice reached a new record low for wintertime maximum extent, according to . Overall, the ice reached just 5.57 million square miles (14.42 million square kilometers), which is 37,000 sq mi (97,00 sq km) smaller than the previous record low set in 2015, and 471,000 sq mi (1.22 million sq km) smaller than the average maximum extent for 1981-2010. In fact, on Feb. 13, 2017, the combined level of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice was at its lowest point since satellites began measuring polar ice in 1979. According to , the total polar sea ice on this date covered only 6.26 million square miles (16.21 million square km). This number is 790,000 square miles (2 million square km) smaller than the average global minimum extent for 1981-2010. This is equivalent to losing a chunk of sea ice bigger than Mexico. The most frequent above-ice inhabitants of the Arctic are migratory birds, such as the small snow bunting, fulmar, kittiwake and the Arctic tern, which has the longest migration of any bird, traveling 43,000 miles (69,200 km) round trip from the North to South Pole every year. Caribou and Arctic foxes do not venture to the North Pole; polar bears make rare appearances. Under the ice, one finds small crustaceans, shrimp, sea anemones and several species of fish, the most common being the Arctic cod. Marine mammals such as narwhals and other whales rarely venture so far north, though ring seals have been spotted occasionally. The Arctic had been explored for centuries as expeditions sought a Northwest Passage — a sea route from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans. The 19th century brought the first major attempts to reach the North Pole. British Admiral William Edward Parry led an expedition in 1827, followed by Norwegian explorers on a land-based trek, a Swedish explorer who tried to reach it by hydrogen balloon, and many others. None of these expeditions was successful. Peary vs. Cook In the early 20th century, two explorers each claimed to have reached the North Pole first. An American physician, Frederick Albert Cook, announced in September 1909 that he and two Inuit companions had reached the pole on April 21, 1908. A week later, American explorer Robert E. Peary claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909, accompanied by Matthew Henson, the first African-American Arctic explorer, and four Inuit men. Peary had powerful sponsors, including The New York Times and the National Geographic Society, which had funded the expedition. Peary, who had made two previous attempts to reach the pole, called Cook a fraud. To make their case, the men published accounts of their journeys in a booklet titled At the Pole With Cook and Peary, which became a bestseller and helped sway public opinion. Over the years, the controversy simmered. However, new research in 1988 revealed that Peary's claim might have been suspect. Questionable elements of his claim included: the lack of navigational experience on his team; the fact that after the one person who had navigational experience left the team, they reported traveling at twice the speed; that one member's route description differed from Peary's; and that Peary never made his records available for review. In 2005, British explorer Tom Avery mimicked Peary's route using dog sleds, and reached the pole, suggesting that Peary's records might have been accurate. The Peary vs. Cook debate remains controversial to this day. Admiral Byrd Since the days of Peary and Cook, many expeditions to the North Pole have taken place by plane, by foot and by dog sled. In 1926, American explorer and retired Navy admiral Richard Byrd claimed that he and his pilot, Floyd Bennett, had flown over the North Pole. The National Geographic Society, one of his sponsors, confirmed the accomplishment. Byrd was hailed as a hero, given the Medal of Honor and went on to fly over the South Pole, as well as achieving many other polar expedition milestones. However, Byrd's accomplishment was questioned almost immediately. Many did not think his airplane could have covered the distance in just 15 hours and 44 minutes, as he had recorded. New research, published in the January 2013 issue of the journal Polar Record, suggests that by as much as 80 miles (130 km). Roald Amundsen The first verifiable, convincing expedition to the pole is credited to Roald Amundsen, an intrepid Norwegian explorer. In 1903, Amundsen led the first expedition to cross the Northwest Passage. In 1911, Amundsen was the . And in May 1926 (just a few days after Byrd's flight), Amundsen flew — or rather, floated — over the pole in a dirigible, the Norge, with 15 other men. April 23, 1948: Three Soviet crews land the first planes at the pole. Aug. 3, 1958: The submarine USS Nautilus is the first naval vessel to reach the pole. April 19, 1968: Ralph Plaisted of Minnesota reaches the pole by snowmobile. 1968-1969: Wally Herbert reaches the pole by dogsled (the first person to reach it on foot). Aug. 17, 1977: The Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker Arktika is the first surface ship to reach the pole. May 1, 1986: The first expedition to reach the pole on foot without resupply includes Ann Bancroft, the first woman to travel to the pole. 2007 : British lawyer and endurance swimmer Lewis Gordon Pugh swims 18 minutes for one kilometer in the Arctic Ocean at the North Pole. His feat, accomplished wearing only a swim brief, was done to draw public attention to the melting ice caps. Currently, no country owns the North Pole. It sits in international waters. The closest land is Canadian territory Nunavut, followed by Greenland (part of the Kingdom of Denmark). However, Russia, Denmark and Canada have staked claims to the mountainous Lomonosov Ridge that runs under the pole. The Arctic is rich in natural resources, including oil and gas, and valuable as a shipping route, making it of high importance to countries with Arctic coasts. In 2007, Russia sent the first submersible to reach the seabed under the North Pole, and dropped a titanium flag there — much to the displeasure of the other Arctic countries. In December 2013, Canada to submit a proposal to the United Nations claiming the North Pole as part of Canadian territory. Their claim will not go unchallenged — both Russia and Denmark are expected to file claims, as well. But the North Pole really belongs to … Santa Claus Believers know that no matter what the science or explorers say, the North Pole is home to and toy-making hard at work. Canada's postal service claims itself among these believers, giving the postal code HOH OHO to letters addressed to Santa at the North Pole. Alaska has a Christmas-themed town known as North Pole, though it is actually nowhere near the North Pole. Other Arctic countries claim Santa's residence, mostly notably Finland. The idea that the jolly old elf lived in Lapland gained popularity during the 1920s. No one knows precisely where the legend of living at the North Pole came from, but many identify American illustrator Thomas Nast as the man who officially gave Santa his residence. In 1866, Nast, whose images of Santa helped to popularize the American idea of the icon, published a drawing called Santa Claus and His Works in Harper's Weekly. The image features the words Santa Clausville, N.P. At the time, the Arctic was a place of public fascination and expeditions received a great deal of attention, so viewers would have understood Nast's abbreviation.

        "html_text": "For most of history, the North Pole was the stuff of legends and wild theories. But even after European explorers got close to it in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the North Pole remained mysterious. Here are 11 facts we know about the North Pole so far. Besides visiting explorers, tourists, and researchers, humans at the North Pole. And because there are no permanent settlements, the North Pole has not been assigned a time zone. People at the North Pole can choose to go by any time zone that is convenient. The closest permanently inhabited is Alert, a military installation 600 miles to the south on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada, and it’s in the . The North Pole at all. Instead, it’s made up of huge ice floes, 6 to 10 feet thick, that float on the surface of the Arctic Ocean. Beneath the ice, the water is 13,400 feet deep. At the North Pole, there is only either . The sun rises around the spring equinox on March 20 and stays in the sky for a full six months before finally setting around the fall equinox on September 22. Through the winter, the North Pole is dark 24 hours a day until the sun finally begins to reappear in March. In the early 20th century, the North Pole was one of the last places on Earth yet to be “discovered.” That changed in 1909 when, in the same September week, newspapers reported that not one but two explorers had made it to the top of the world. The famous American explorer claimed to have reached his destination in April 1909, his eighth attempt. But another American explorer, Frederick E. Cook, came out of nowhere to claim he was first in April 1908, a full year before Peary. Despite the competing reports, Peary was widely acknowledged as the first at the North Pole when, after re-examining his records, the National Geographic Society concluded that he might not have made it to the North Pole after all. Even if he did, it’s likely that his teammates, and four Inughuit guides Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah, were actually the first to —because Peary had to ride on a sled due to the loss of eight toes to frostbite. Unlike in , where permanent research stations were established as the 1940s, there is no equivalent at the North Pole. The Soviet Union established the first temporary research station there . Planes dropped four men, including an oceanographer, a meteorologist, and a radio operator, on a 10-foot-thick ice floe in March, and over the next year they the Arctic environment. When the expedition concluded in February 1938, rescuers found the station not where they left it, but drifting in the Greenland Sea, 1615 miles away. After several failed rescue attempts, all four researchers were safely evacuated and returned home. Santa Claus, the North Pole’s most famous resident, didn’t always live within the Arctic Circle. Saint Nicholas, the 4th-century religious figure from whom the myth of Santa Claus is derived, came from Myra, a Roman town in what is now Turkey. But in the mid-1800s, cartoonist Thomas Nast began the saintly character as we know him today: fat, jolly, and with a sack full of toys. Because a flurry of American and European expeditions to the Arctic captured the world’s imagination around the same period, Nast selected the fabled location for Santa’s permanent home. In 2007, two Russian submarines on a record-breaking dive to the seabed of the North Pole, two-and-a-half miles beneath the surface of the Arctic Ocean. But it was oil and gas, not the thrill of exploration, that drove their expedition. On the ocean floor, the submarines planted a 3-foot Russian flag made of corrosion-resistant titanium, staking its claim to what is believed to be almost a quarter of the Earth’s oil and gas reserves underneath. Russia argued that the North Pole is merely an extension of the Lomonosov Ridge, an underwater chain of hills extending from the Russian mainland, and therefore Russian territory. Denmark argued that the ridge is actually an extension of Greenland, and thus Danish territory. While Russia congratulated itself for the move, the rest of the world was not amused. More than a decade on, to the North Pole’s resources been recognized by the United Nations. Despite the frigid and fluctuating climate, the Arctic is incredibly biodiverse. More than of plants and animals are adapted to the extreme landscapes. But at the North Pole, where there is no land or terrestrial flora and fauna, wildlife is fewer and farther between. Arctic cod, shrimp, and crustaceans live at various depths under the sea ice, while the most common sights above the ice are migrating birds, such as Arctic terns, fulmars, kittiwakes, and snow buntings. In 1987, Tokyo motorcycle shop owner and racer left Canada’s Ward Hunt Island bound for the North Pole on his Yamaha TW200. Kazama and the five members of his support team traveled 1250 miles over sea ice in that, at times, the motorcycle could only travel 30 feet per hour. It took the adventurer 44 days to reach his destination. Five years later, in 1992, Kazama completed the same feat at the South Pole, becoming the first and only person to have ever reached both poles by motorcycle. Since 2003, the North Pole has hosted an April for the world’s most extreme athletes. The 26.2-mile race is run on a hard snow and ice track with competitors braving frigid temperatures that, in past years, have dropped as low as -20°F (-29°C). The current record for the fastest time at the FWD North Pole Marathon is held by Irishman , who ran the race in three hours and 36 minutes in 2007. The Arctic is at twice the rate of the rest of the globe. As the climate crisis deepens, scientists that within fewer than three decades, sea ice cover will completely disappear in the summer months unless global emissions can be significantly reduced—and quickly. And because what happens at the North Pole the entire Earth, the seasonal disappearance of ice will likely lead to rising sea levels, more severe weather events, and drastic changes in climate and precipitation on all seven continents. © 2023 - All Rights Reserved "

        "html_text": " is a point on the Northern Hemisphere where the world’s rotational axis meets with the surface of the earth. It is in the Arctic Ocean in the middle of the water, and it is always covered with a permanently shifting sea ice. It is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere and on the northern side of Greenland, Russia, and Canada. Even though the North Pole does not belong to any continent, it is not considered to be a continent on its own. The North Pole is a magnetic region where the magnetic fields of the world meet. The actual magnetic pole is not constant. The Canadian Geographical survey determined that the North Magnetic pole is in western Ellesmere, Canada in 2001. All the directions at the North Pole point towards the South Pole and all the longitude lines converge here. The ice covering it is about 10 ft thick, and the ocean’s depth at that point is over 13,123 ft deep. The only three continents close to the North Pole are Asia, Europe, and North America. The nearest inhabited region is Alert, Canada which is 508 miles from the North Pole. Even though the two biggest nations of North America, the United States and Canada have some land on the Arctic Circle, the North Pole is not part of North America. North America is 3,036 miles to the south of the North Pole. North America is in the Northern Hemisphere and about 3,184 miles from the Equator. The European nation which is close to this point is one of Denmark Kingdom’s constituent countries known as Greenland. Denmark itself is 2,349.9 miles to the south of the North Pole. The Kaffeklubben Island, Greenland is about 430 miles from the North Pole. Kaffeklubben Island is on the northern tip of Greenland. Asia is about 6,223 miles to the southern parts of the North Pole. Russia is the only Asian state with some cities on the Arctic Circle. About 2,100,000 sq miles of Russia is on the northern parts of the Arctic Circle. Russia is on the Northern Hemisphere and about 3,337 miles south of this position. South America is in the Southern Hemisphere and about 3,657 miles to the south of the North Pole. Australia is on the Southern Hemisphere and about 7,948 miles from the North Pole with Africa being even further south. Antarctica is on the opposite side of the Arctic and the home to the South Pole. Antarctica is about 12,430 miles to the south of the North Pole, and unlike the Arctic, it is a continent. The North Pole is on the sea ice in the Arctic and not on any continent. Unlike Antarctica which is considered to be a continent, the Arctic is not a continent. A continent is any of the earth's continuous expanse of land mass, and the Arctic is just an ice sheet floating on the Arctic Ocean. Even though it has some land masses surrounding it, the Arctic is mostly ocean. All maps, graphics, flags, photos and original descriptions © 2023 worldatlas.com "

(Eric Chretien / Gamma-Rapho / Getty Images) Also known as True North, the Geographic North Pole is the northernmost point on the planet. Sitting in the middle of the Arctic Ocean at 90 degrees north, it is where the Earth spins on its axis. Its geographic position allows it to point to the North Star, Polaris, which can help navigators find their way. Near the Geographic North Pole is the , a temporary research facility and tourist center that drifts on an Arctic ice sheet. So, where is the north pole located? Despite Pole being in its name, the Geographic North Pole is not located exactly at a magnetic pole of the planet. Map of the Arctic Circle, with the three North Poles pinpointed, as of 2017. (Cavit / NOAA) Unlike the Geographic North Pole, the North Magnetic Pole, also known as the Magnetic North Pole, is aligned with the planet’s magnetic field. Earth is a giant magnet, as the motion of liquid metal in the Earth’s outer core generates a geomagnetic field that wraps around the planet, according to NOAA Senior Research Scientist Arnaud Chulliat. Chulliat noted that the North Magnetic Pole, or Magnetic North Pole, is located where the geomagnetic field is exactly vertical in the Northern Hemisphere. Mark Conde, professor of physics and the lead for the mission in the study, discusses how a NASA rocket will study the mysterious area above the North Pole. The magnetic force at the North Magnetic Pole attracts the north needle of , which is how compasses and GPS navigation systems orient themselves to the North Magnetic Pole. Earth’s magnetic field, however, constantly changes. Because of this, the North Magnetic Pole's location also changes. Positions of the North Magnetic Pole during 1831 - 2007 are noted in yellow squares. Modeled pole locations from 1590 to 2020 are circles progressing from blue to yellow. (NCEI / NOAA) Ever since it was discovered in northern Canada in 1831, the North Magnetic Pole has been moving north-northwest across the Canadian Arctic toward Russia. According to NOAA, a survey conducted in 2007 determined that it was moving at about 34 miles per year, but a recent survey showed that it has slowed down to about 28 miles per year. Where is the Magnetic North Pole on a map? The North Magnetic Pole is currently located near 86.146 degrees north by 146.826 degrees east, according to the World Magnetic Model 2020. Sea ice (R) is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft on March 29, 2017 above Ellesmere Island, Canada. (Mario Tama / Getty Images) According to Chulliat, the planet’s magnetic field is complicated, and it is not an exact dipole – meaning that it does not have two perfectly opposite ends like your typical magnet. Because of this, the North and South Magnetic Poles are not on exact opposite ends of the Earth. By imagining a straight bar magnet cutting through the Earth’s core, however, scientists can approximate the North and South ends of our planet's giant magnet. Those locations are called the North and South Geomagnetic Poles. According to the International Geomagnetic Reference Field model, the North Geomagnetic Pole is currently located near 80.8 degrees north by 72.7 degrees west, in Ellesmere Island, Canada.

And now, visualize the immersive maps and stories you've created with Google Earth on web on your mobile device. Version 9.175 This version includes bug fixes. Recently added features: - Added Apple Pencil support to the measure tool. 33.5K Ratings I have been using the Google Earth engine for about 2 years now and I have absolutely loved the app, but there are some wacky things to fix. I am writing this review about the new update, as I was scrolling around the small town I live at (Elko, NV) I was very unsatisfied about the new street view update, there were new images of the towns streets but there was so much a mix of images from years back that are still not updated and they make me very uncomfortable and I don’t understand why you can’t update the whole town in the same day. I know 3Ding buildings on Earth can be difficult but why can’t a town of 21,000 people be in 3D? I think it would be nice to have new images of my small town in 3D, the imagery and the time lapses of this app are great and I Am in love with them but please fix things I mention in this review and try updating more often. It takes a lot of disappointment for me to write reviews but this app is just so flat. It’s like they took what they were in the process of developing years ago and just threw it up without even looking at it for a quick review. I am terrible at geography and thought this would help me with a class I’m taking but I was mistaken. You can’t adjust any type of visual settings so if you zoom too far in on, say, China, you get a million different location names in English and Chinese and you can’t even see the land under all the text. Also, it would be really enjoyable (and easier on my old lady eyes) to be able to make borders bold or different colors or even cut out a region to view it individually. It is absolutely impossible to tell one country/state from the next with the impossibly thin tan line separating everything that, oh yea, is the same color that is used for most of the landscape. What a mess. Overall really great concept but what I’m gathering from other reviews, the app particularly for iPad is super low quality compared to others. I now know that if I had a desktop I’d be able to look at the moon and mars so I feel really gypped now. And yes, even though I didn’t pay anything I still feel shortchanged. Google earth I’d like to be able to see updated pictures of not only cities but also the outdoors even if I was charged for this app I wouldn’t mind . I give google earth a four star mainly because I can see a satellite picture of the outdoors and see what it used to look like on my iPhone even if the image shows 2022 I know it is an older image because we visit this area quite ofen we still use this site for a variety of reasons one being whether certain land is public or private gated or not on certain image’s land shows drought when it is actually full of water I’ve been seeing this same image for over 7 year’s . The picture of cities gets updated but the land pictures remain the same as the original image google earth could be so much better if everything was updated when new images are loaded .

Google Earth is able to show various kinds of images overlaid on the surface of the earth and is also a client. In 2019, has revealed that Google Earth now covers more than 97 percent of the world, and has captured 10 million miles of Street View imagery. In addition to Earth navigation, Google Earth provides a series of other tools through the desktop application, including a measure distance tool. Additional globes for the and are available, as well as a tool for viewing the . A game is also included. Other features allow users to view photos from various places uploaded to , information provided by on some locations, and Street View imagery. The web-based version of Google Earth also includes Voyager, a feature that periodically adds in-program tours, often presented by scientists and documentarians. Google Earth has been viewed by some as a threat to and , leading to the program being banned in multiple countries. Some countries have requested that certain areas be obscured in Google's satellite images, usually areas containing military facilities. The core behind Google Earth was originally developed at Intrinsic Graphics in the late 1990s. At the time, the company was developing 3D gaming software libraries. As a demo of their 3D software, they created a spinning globe that could be zoomed into, similar to the film. The demo was popular, but the board of Intrinsic wanted to remain focused on gaming, so in 1999, they created Keyhole, Inc., headed by . Keyhole then developed a way to stream large databases of mapping data over the internet to client software, a key part of the technology, and acquired patchworks of mapping data from governments and other sources. The product, called Keyhole EarthViewer, was sold on CDs for use in fields such as , , , and ; users paid a yearly fee for the service. Despite making a number of capital deals with and , the small company was struggling to pay and retain employees. Fortunes for the company changed in early 2003 during the , when Dave Lorenzini (Director at Keyhole) enticed , , and other major news networks to use their sophisticated 3D flyby imagery to illustrate Baghdad Activities, in exchange for on-air attribution. During the invasion, It was used extensively by and other on-air broadcasters, allowing CNN and millions of viewers to follow the progress of the war in a way that had never been seen before. Public interest in the software exploded and Keyhole servers were not able to keep up with demand. Keyhole was soon contacted by the 's venture capital firm, , and the , for use with defense mapping databases, which gave Keyhole a much-needed cash infusion. Intrinsic Graphics was sold in 2003 to after its gaming libraries did not sell well, and its core group of engineers and management including Brian McClendon and Michael Jones transitioned to Keyhole with Hanke remaining at the head. At the time, Google was finding that over 25% of its searches were of a geospatial character, including searches for maps and directions. In October 2004, Google acquired Keyhole as part of a strategy to better serve its users. In 2021 Google replaced its layers feature with a new one on its Google Earth software. This replacement consolidated some layers, but also removed some layers and features. Google Earth's imagery is displayed on a digital , which displays the planet's surface using a single composited image from a far distance. After zooming in far enough, the imagery transitions into different imagery of the same area with finer detail, which varies in date and time from one area to the next. The imagery is retrieved from or . Before the launch of and the satellite, Google relied partially on imagery from , which suffered from a hardware malfunction that left diagonal gaps in images. In 2013, Google used to remedy the issue, providing what was described as a successor to the image of Earth, with a single large image of the entire planet. This was achieved by combining multiple sets of imagery taken from Landsat 7 to eliminate clouds and diagonal gaps, creating a single mosaic image. Google now uses a myriad of sources to provide imagery in a higher quality and with greater frequency. Imagery is hosted on Google's servers, which are contacted by the application when opened, requiring an Internet connection. Imagery resolution ranges from 15 meters of resolution to 15 centimeters. For much of the Earth, Google Earth uses data collected by 's . This creates the impression of three-dimensional terrain, even where the imagery is only two-dimensional. Google asserts that every image created from Google Earth using satellite data provided by Google Earth is a map. Any derivative from Google Earth is made from data on which Google claims copyright under . Google grants licenses in this data allowing, among other things, non-commercial personal use of the images (e.g., on a personal website or blog) as long as copyrights and attributions are preserved. By contrast, images created with NASA's globe software use , , or USGS imagery, each of which is in the . In version 5.0, Google introduced Historical Imagery, allowing users to view earlier imagery. Clicking the icon in the toolbar opens a time slider, which marks the time of available imagery from the past. This feature allows for observation of an area's changes over time. Utilizing the timelapse feature allows for the ability to view a zoomable video as far back as 32 years. Google Earth shows in some cities, including photorealistic 3D imagery made using . The first 3D buildings in Google Earth were created using applications such as and, beginning in 2009, , and were uploaded to Google Earth via the . In June 2012, Google announced that it would be replacing user-generated 3D buildings with an auto-generated 3D mesh. This would be phased in, starting with select larger cities, with the notable exception of cities such as and which required more time to process detailed imagery of their vast number of buildings. The reason given is to have greater uniformity in 3D buildings and to compete with and , which were already using this technology. The coverage began that year in 21 cities in four countries. By early 2016, 3D imagery had been expanded to hundreds of cities in over 40 countries, including every and encompassing every continent except Antarctica. In 2009, in a collaboration between and the in , the museum selected 14 of its paintings to be photographed and displayed at the resolution of 14,000 inside the 3D version of the Prado in Google Earth and . On April 15, 2008, with version 4.3, Google fully integrated into Google Earth. Street View displays 360° panoramic street-level photos of select cities and their surroundings. The photos were taken by cameras mounted on automobiles, can be viewed at different scales and from many angles, and are navigable by arrow icons imposed on them. Using the Street View on Google Earth, users can visit and explore 30 UNESCO with historical context and pins for each. The sites include the , the , , the , the , and the . In 2019, Walt Disney World partnered with Google to create Pixar Street View. A unique activation that enabled viewers to search for hidden Pixar Easter eggs in Toy Story Land at Disney's Hollywood Studios through street view. This creative collaboration elevated Pixar's iconic tradition of hiding Easter eggs in films and introduced it to an immersive new platform. Introduced in Google Earth 5.0 in 2009, the Google Ocean feature allows users to zoom below the surface of the ocean and view the 3D . Supporting over 20 content layers, it contains information from leading scientists and . On April 14, 2009, Google added bathymetric data for the . In June 2011, Google increased the resolution of some deep ocean floor areas from 1-kilometer grids to 100 meters. The high-resolution features were developed by oceanographers at Columbia University's Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory from scientific data collected on research cruises. The sharper focus is available for about 5 percent of the oceans. This can be seen in the Hudson off New York City, the Wini Seamount near Hawaii, and the off the U.S. Pacific coast. Google has programs and features, including within Google Earth, allowing exploration of , the , the view of the sky from Earth and , including the surfaces of various objects in the . Google Sky is a feature that was introduced in Google Earth 4.2 on August 22, 2007, in a browser-based application on March 13, 2008, and to , with features. Google Sky allows users to view and other celestial bodies. It was produced by through a partnership with the (STScI) in Baltimore, the science operations center for the . Dr. and his co-developer Dr. Carol Christian of STScI planned to add the public images from 2007, as well as color images of all of the archived data from Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys. Then-newly released pictures were added to the Google Sky program as soon as they were issued. New features such as multi-wavelength data, positions of major satellites and their as well as educational resources are provided to the Google Earth community and also through Christian and Conti's website for Sky. Also visible on Sky mode are constellations, stars, galaxies, and animations depicting the planets in their orbits. A real-time Google Sky of recent astronomical transients, using the protocol, is provided by the VOEventNet collaboration. Other programs similar to Google Sky include and . Google Mars is an application within Google Earth that is a version of the program for imagery of the planet Mars. Google also operates a browser-based version, although the maps are of a much higher resolution within Google Earth, and include 3D terrain, as well as imagery and elevation data. There are also some extremely high-resolution images from the 's camera that are of a similar resolution to those of the cities on Earth. Finally, there are many high-resolution panoramic images from various Mars landers, such as the , and , that can be viewed in a similar way to . Mars also has a small application found near the . It is called Meliza, a robot character the user can speak with. Originally a browser application, Google Moon is a feature that allows exploration of the Moon. Google brought the feature to Google Earth for the 40th anniversary of the mission on July 20, 2009. It was announced and demonstrated to a group of invited guests by Google along with at the in Google Moon includes several tours, including one for the , incorporating maps, videos, and Street View-style panoramas, all provided by . Google Earth has numerous features that allow the user to learn about specific places. These are called layers, and include different forms of media, including photo and video. Some layers include tours, which guide the user between specific places in a set order. Layers are created using the , or KML, which users can also use to create customized layers. Locations can be marked with placemarks and organized in folders; For example, a user can use placemarks to list interesting landmarks around the globe, then provide a description with photos and videos, which can be viewed by clicking on the placemarks while viewing the new layer in the application. In December 2006, Google Earth added a new integration with and . For the Wikipedia layer, entries are for coordinates via the . There is also a community layer from the project . More coordinates are used, different types are in the display, and different languages are supported than the built-in Wikipedia layer. The Panoramio layer features pictures uploaded by Panoramio users, placed in Google Earth based on user-provided location data. In addition to flat images, Google Earth also includes a layer for user-submitted panoramic photos, navigable in a similar way to Street View. Google Earth includes multiple features that allow the user to monitor current events. In 2007, Google began offering users the ability to monitor traffic data provided by in real-time, based on information from the GPS-identified locations of cell phone users. In Google Earth 4.2, a was added to the application. It was originally a when introduced in 2007, but starting with 4.3, it was given a labeled option in the menu. In addition to keyboard control, the simulator can be controlled with a mouse or joystick. The simulator also runs with animation, allowing objects such as planes to animate while on the simulator. Another flight simulator, , was created under the name GEFS-Online using the Google Earth Plug-in to operate within a .

Non-profit organizations featured in Google Earth via the Outreach program include , the , , and the . Google Earth Engine is a platform for processing and other geospatial and observation data. It provides access to a large database of satellite imagery and the computational power needed to analyze those images. Google Earth Engine allows observation of dynamic changes in agriculture, natural resources, and climate using geospatial data from the satellite program, which the same places on the Earth every sixteen days. Google Earth Engine has become a platform that makes Landsat and Sentinel-2 data easily accessible to researchers in collaboration with the Google Cloud Storage. Google Earth Engine provides a data catalog along with computers for analysis; this allows scientists to collaborate using data, algorithms, and visualizations. The platform provides Python and JavaScript application programming interfaces for making requests to the servers, and includes a graphical user interface for developing applications. An early prototype of Earth Engine, based on the CLASlite system and ’s Sistema de Alerta de Desmatamento (SAD) was demonstrated in 2009 at , and Earth Engine was officially launched in 2010 at , along with maps of the water in the and forests in Mexico produced by researchers using the tool. In 2013, researchers from produced the first high-resolution global forest cover and loss maps using Earth Engine, reporting an overall loss in global forest cover.

In particular, the International Journal of Digital Earth features multiple articles evaluating and comparing the development of Google Earth and its differences when compared to other professional, scientific, and governmental platforms.

Most of the images in Google Earth were acquired within the past three years, and Google is continuously updating the image set for different parts of the Earth. Large cities generally have more recent and higher resolution images than sparsely inhabited areas. A misconception exists among some people that the images displayed in the Google Earth program are live-updated directly from satellites. This is not the case. The images are acquired by satellites, processed by commercial image providers or government agencies, and then updated to the Google Earth image database in batches. However, Google and its image providers do have the ability to rapidly integrate new images into the program. This is sometimes done in emergency situations - such as when an area has been hit by a natural disaster and new images would be of valuable assistance to the recovery and relief efforts.

Your wireless signal will need to travel from your router to where you are in your home. Putting your router in a utility closet is probably not the best choice, if your utility closet is in your basement and you spend all day upstairs. You may want to reconsider a more central location for your router. Materials such as concrete, metal, brick and sheetrock - you know the stuff your walls are made from - can and will impact the strength of your wireless signal. If you continue to have issues with your current router, it may be time to upgrade. If after talking with our support department and we have walked you through factory resetting your router and updating the firmware with no change to performance, then it may be time to get a new router.

        "description": "Big Nate is an American comic strip written and illustrated by Lincoln syndicated since January The strip follows Nate",
        "html_text": " Big Nate (stylized as big NATE in the and BiG NATE in the ) is an American written and illustrated by , syndicated since January 7, 1991. The strip follows sixth-grader Nate Wright, alongside his family, friends, and foes. The strip's success led to a , consisting of two series of children's books by - the eponymous novel series and the Little Big Nate board books - and an , which premiered on in 2022. Big Nate follows the adventures and misadventures of Nate Wright, an incompetent, spirited, and rebellious . He has three best friends, Francis, Teddy, and Dee Dee who occasionally get in trouble with him. Other characters include a variety of teachers and students at Nate’s school, Public School 38. Nate hates social studies teacher Mrs. Godfrey, whom he considers his nemesis, and calls her names like “the school's ”. He has a love-hate relationship with Artur, a foreign exchange student who is the boyfriend of Jenny, Nate’s crush. Nate also loathes Gina, a “teacher’s pet” who gets good grades and is constantly acting like a suck-up to Mrs. Godfrey. Peirce occasionally focuses on Nate's home life with his single father, Martin, and girly sister Ellen. Answering questions from fans in '' , Peirce revealed the following about the creation of the strip: Big Nate started as more of a domestic humor strip than it is now. I intended to feature a lot of stories about Nate's single dad, and all the comic possibilities inherent in that. But before too long, I realized that the part of the strip that I enjoyed most was the school humor. I'd been a teacher myself, and schools can be very funny places. Enslave the Mollusk (ETM) is a featured in Big Nate . It features Nate as backing vocalist and , with best friends Francis on electric and Teddy on , as well as Artur as lead vocalist. Chad is the band's roadie. Enslave the Mollusk had a big role in Big Nate the Musical. They performed 3 times: twice during the In The Zone novel when P.S 38 was starting a fitness zone but the first time Artur wasn't there because he quit the band, but eventually rejoined by their last performance, and also at one of the school dances. They tried to perform at another school dance but failed because of a power outage. Nate was originally lead singer as he formed the band but wasn't good enough, which was realized after Artur passed by the band playing one day. Artur then sang a rendition of and was hired as the band's lead singer. He quit in the middle of Big Nate: In The Zone after he found a slip of paper with rude nicknames for him that Nate wrote, but was enticed back by the end of the book. Femme Fatality is Nate's favorite super-hero comic. The images are never shown, but there were a few appearances of the eponymous character, as a life-size cardboard cut-out in a 2002 comic and as a cosplay actor visiting Klassic Komix in 2004. The character is highly suggestive, judging from the reaction of Nate and most of the other male characters (including adults). One comic claimed that she was wearing a skin tight and mini-shorts. Some of the girls show exasperation over Nate's obsession with the comic, but Nate insists he reads it only for the stories. One of Nate's previous comic book crushes was Red Sonja. Femme Fatality later inspired Nate to create his own super-hero comic called Eve of Destruction, though he later changed the character to male, and called the comic Steve of Destruction. P.S. 38 is the Nate and his friends attend and is where most of the comics take place. The school is noted to be over 100 years old and is considerably run down, but was remodeled in Big Nate: Lives It Up after a painting by local folk artist Granny Peppers was found to be worth a lot of money. Jefferson Middle School is a middle school near P.S. 38 and is the school's sister institution. In stark contrast to P.S. 38, Jefferson is portrayed as a large modern building with numerous 21st century features. It has been described as more of a museum than a school. The middle school's kids are the rivals of P.S. 38's kids and beat them in almost everything. Most Jefferson kids are always obnoxious about this. P.S. 38 beat Jefferson in the 'Ultimate Snowdown', the 1st and 38th 'Mud Bowl', and their big 2008 soccer game. Jefferson lost the Snowdown, because they took an uncreative approach by packing snow around the spare knight statue. 44 print collections and novel books, as well as six activity books, have been published. In May 2013, a adaptation of the comic strip debuted at the Adventure Theatre MTC in . The production's story centers on Nate, who tries to enter his school's competition but must try to avoid getting anymore , as too many would disqualify his band from competing. Critical reception for the musical has been positive. On February 19, 2020, it was announced that Big Nate would receive a , which was slated to air on in September 2021 but was delayed to 2022. In December 2021, the voice cast was announced, as was that the series would instead be for . It would eventually air on Nickelodeon on September 5, 2022. "

        "html_text": "A high-quality drone can add production value to a film project or help you get a unique view for your travel vlog—plus, they're just really fun to fly. These are the top drones we've tested. Images, and the devices that capture them, are my focus. I've covered cameras at PCMag for the past 10 years, which has given me a front row seat for the DSLR to mirrorless transition, the smartphone camera revolution, and the mainstream adoption of drones for aerial imaging. You can find me on Instagram . Even if you have no good reason to justify buying one, you have to admit that drones are cool. Some are glorified tech toys, but the models we highlight here are fit for imaging and cinematic applications both small and large. If you think you can use a flying camera in your next project, there's some good news—the tech has come a long way in a very short time. Some models on the market now put earlier copters to shame in terms of video quality and stabilization. And, now the bad news: You get what you pay for. If you want an aerial video platform that can capture stunning footage, you need to spend some cash, anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Because drones are such pricey propositions, it pays to do your research before buying one. We don't focus on racing, industrial, or agricultural aircraft here—our coverage is squarely on imaging and video. The drones we review are ready-to-fly models, so you can use them right out of the box. Read on for the top drones we've tested, followed by everything you need to know about choosing the right model for your needs and budget. *Deals are selected by our commerce team The DJI Mini 2 is the best drone you can get for less than $500. It sports a stabilized, three-axis gimbal 4K video camera that also snaps 12MP photos, as well as includes GPS and Find My Drone functions. Its 249g takeoff weight means you can fly it without dealing with FAA registration—you just need to pass an online knowledge test. We also like the nearly half-hour flight times, though we wish DJI had worked obstacle detection into this model. The Mini 2 is the drone to get if you're just starting out and want to record ultra-smooth 4K30 footage from the air or take aerial photos—Raw format is available for photogs who like to post-process. It's very stable, even when flying near the 400-foot altitude limit, and smoothly streams live video from the camera to a smartphone app. If you want to spend even less, the is available for $369; it's the same drone, but has a 2.7K30 camera instead. The DJI Mini 3 Pro is the most capable ultralight drone on the market. Its 249g takeoff weight (with a 34-minute battery) means you can get around FAA registration, though creators who don't mind forms and fees can add in an extended life battery to push flights beyond 45 minutes. Three-way obstacle sensors, automated flight modes, and 4K60 video round out the feature set. We especially like the APAS function, an autopilot that can navigate through complex spaces all by itself, for low-to-the-ground use. If you've looked at the Mini 3 and wanted a bit more, the Mini 3 Pro is a sensible step-up. Drone enthusiasts, cinematographers looking to add a B-camera for aerials, and creators who don't mind spending a bit more for smart obstacle avoidance should find the Mini 3 Pro to be a worthwhile upgrade. It's also a good match for TikTok influencers because it supports vertical 9:16 video. The DJI Air 2S has a camera with an oversized Type 1 (also called 1-inch) sensor for much better 20MP stills than you can get from the DJI Mini series drones. It supports 5.4K30 and 4K60 video with HDR, flat, or standard profiles, plus it can snap photos in Raw or JPG format. DJI's strong safety features are here too, including GPS location, obstacle sensors, ADS-B to warn you of nearby manned aircraft, and a 30-minute battery. The Air 2S is a compelling drone for stills-first creators. The Type 1 sensor may lag behind Quad Bayer chips in pixel count, but captures a wider dynamic range, so photogs have more leeway for edits to exposure. Video pros should appreciate the 5.4K resolution and choice of three profiles too, but you may want to step up to a Mavic 3 for more serious cinema work. Keep in mind that you must register this drone with the FAA. The DJI Mavic 3 sports the best drone camera of any foldable model. A big Four Thirds format sensor with a Hasselblad color profile delivers excellent footage and stills straight-out-of-camera. All-around obstacle sensors allow the drone to fly around obstructions, an integrated GPS keeps it steady in the air, and forty-plus-minute flying times make for safer flights. Dedicated pros can step up to the Cine version ($4,999), which adds 1TB SSD storage and ProRes 422 video. If you want to spend less, the Classic edition drops the telephoto camera and cuts the cost to $1,599. The Mavic 3 is ideal for cinematographers, indie filmmakers, vloggers, and other creative professionals. The drone is heavy enough to require FAA registration and you need an operator's license to use it for paid work, but it's still small enough to carry in a shoulder bag. If you work on location or travel to beautiful places, the Mavic 3 is a worthwhile splurge, and the Cine version is available for creators with ProRes workflows. The DJI Mini 3 is the drone for pilots who aren't satisfied with the starter camera on the affordable DJI Mini 2 but can't quite justify the Mini 3 Pro. Highlights of the camera include support for 4K30 video with an HDR look in either vertical or landscape orientation, as well as 60 degrees of upward tilt. The photo quality is good, too. The camera supports 12MP JPG or Raw DNG snaps, while the F1.7 optics do a good job at dawn and dusk. Safety features include GPS, Find My Drone, and Return to Home. Its 249g takeoff weight means you can fly it without dealing with FAA registration—you just need to pass an online knowledge test. We also like the 38-minute flight times, though we wish DJI had worked obstacle detection into this model. Creators who want a dual-aspect drone for TikTok and YouTube should consider this drone. It conveniently streams live video straight to a smartphone app, is capable for stills, and remains stable even when you fly it near the 400-foot altitude limit. If you don't want to spend quite so much ($560 with a remote), the Mini 2 is the best alternative. On the other hand, if you can spend more, the Mini 3 Pro adds useful obstacle avoidance sensors. The Autel Evo Lite+ uses a Type 1 sensor camera for picture quality that's competitive with the DJI Air 2S, with the additional benefit of a variable aperture to cut incoming light without the need for ND filters. The folding drone can fly for around 40 minutes on a full battery and supports three-way obstacle sensors to prevent midair accidents. The Autel Evo Lite+ is a capable camera drone for creators who don't want to support DJI. Its 6K camera is capable and, although we wish we could fine-tune the video profile, a flat look is available if you want to edit for color. Its price is a knock against it, though, considering the Air 2S costs around $1,000, but you might find the Lite+ to be worth it for extended flight times and to sidestep DJI's sometimes restrictive geofence. The Autel Robotics Evo Nano+ comes in at 249g, so you don't need to register it with the FAA, though it does include three-way obstacle detection for safer flight. A stabilized camera records 4K30 video and snaps sharp photos at up to 50MP. Battery life is very good too, at about 28 minutes. The Evo Nano+ is a good drone for pilots who want a quadcopter they can take up in the air without baked-in geofencing restrictions, like the DJI FlySafe system that some see as restrictive. The 249g takeoff weight allows you to use it a bit more freely than heavier drones and the picture quality is very good, with aggressive sharpening being the real knock. The Nano+ is a good drone for beginner and advanced pilots alike. The DJI Avata is an FPV drone, one in which you see the camera view through a set of VR goggles, not on a smartphone screen. A nose-mounted camera, motion-sensitive remote, and 30mph Sport mode are there for thrill seekers. Meanwhile, built-in prop guards keep it flying after minor bumps and downward-facing sensors make low-to-the-ground flights possible. You can slow down and take your time too, if you like, for Cinewhoop-style long takes to channel your inner Scorsese and Welles. The Avata is a drone for those who want fast-paced, close-to-the-ground, and elaborately choreographed footage. Take the Avata up high and you might see some wobble in the camera that you don't get with cinema drones, but you can also bank and turn to convey a sense of motion. We like that it's easy enough for anyone to pick up and fly, though pros can swap a dual-stick remote for fully manual flight at 60mph. On the other hand, we're a bit put off by just how easy it is to crash; make sure you have a safe place to fly it. The Ryze Tello is more of a learning toy than a cinema tool. You can fly the small quadcopter with your phone or a controller, like many others, but this goes a step further with support for MIT's Scratch coding platform. If you connect the Tello to a laptop running Scratch, it can execute commands and macros in sequence, giving kids a fun incentive to learn the basics of coding. This is the one drone on the list that's safe enough for tweens and teens to fly. The Tello doesn't have much power and its 720p camera isn't one you'd ever use for a vlog. But its low cost is appealing to parents shopping for a learning toy, even if some kids might just prefer flying around to programming commands. The rules of the air vary from region to region—we've covered what to know for flying in the . But, typically, if your drone weighs 8.8 ounces (250g) or more, you need to register it before you can fly it outdoors legally—even over your own property. You also need to pass a free basic knowledge test online that's pretty easy to ace. You don't need to register some mass-market drones (those that are lighter than 250g), but you still need to take the Trust test. The DJI Mini family is exempt, as is the series. Entry-level models omit obstacle avoidance (included in the Autel Nano and upmarket DJI Mini 3 Pro), but still include GPS stabilization, automated return-to-home, and automatic takeoff and landing. They're safe drones to fly. Almost all of the models here have some safety features. For instance, if your control signal is interrupted or if the battery gets down too low (most drones can only fly for around a half-hour between charges), most of these drones will start to head back to the takeoff point and land. Flyaways still happen, however—there are horror stories on various web discussion forums. Of course, negative experiences are more prevalent in that context, simply because uneventful flights that don't result in a crash or missing drone aren't hot topics for discussion. Some manufacturers offer extended warranties that replace a lost aircraft, but make sure to read the fine print before buying something like DJI Care Refresh—you must consider any associated restrictions and fees. If you're flying within the United States, you need to follow FAA guidelines—or prepare to face potential fines or jail time. The FAA sets , so don't take off if you're near an airport without notifying the control tower first. And, even if you're out in the middle of nowhere, don't take your drone above 400 feet. Most are set to obey these regulations out of the box, but controlling a quadcopter is just like driving a car—even if you didn't see that speed limit sign, you're still liable to pay the ticket. Several products on the market sell as drones but don't quite fit that description. Remote-controlled aircraft have been around for ages. But with the recent surge in popularity, quadcopters that would simply be sold as RC products are now being tagged as drones. These don't include GPS stabilization, return-to-home functionality, and other automated flight modes that make a drone a drone. Drone racing enthusiasts often build their aircraft from kits or parts. Doing so requires some skill with a soldering iron and screwdriver, but it has become an aspect of the hobby itself. DJI has an off-the-shelf racer, the FPV Combo, that can move at a brisk 87mph. We took a at it but weren't comfortable enough with its controls to conduct a full review. Small drones aren't only for racing, either. Some people use tiny, homemade Cinewhoop drones for . GoPro sells an ultralight version of its flagship action cam, called the , for DIY drone builders who want the best video quality for these types of shots. DJI's second FPV model, the Avata, dances between racer and Cinewhoop in attitude. Its built-in prop guards, slim form, and 4K60 camera make it possible to fly in tight confines, and you can push the speed to around 30mph with autopilot assistance if you're looking for a thrill ride. We didn't test the , a toy drone made to work with Snapchat. The market spoke, though, and reports indicate Snapchat shortly after launch (it's still for sale though). DJI models currently dominate our top picks and there's a good reason for that. The company is simply a few steps ahead of its competition right now and offers products at a lot of price levels. It made a huge splash with its iconic Phantom series, and its folding Mini and Air lines (formerly called Mavic) are the best small drones we've tested. Its pro lines offer a lot more power, for more money. Its Inspire and Matrice models can carry heavier payloads, including interchangeable lens systems. They're overkill for most consumers, however, and not nearly as convenient to carry. Some pilots are sour on DJI, though. Its FlySafe geofencing system adds an authorization requirement to areas with flight restrictions. Professional operators who are allowed to fly may find the process of getting up in the air to be too cumbersome with a DJI drone. And, from an ethical standpoint, the for aiding the Chinese government's surveillance of the persecuted Uyghur ethnic group in what is considered a . If that leaves you feeling icky, consider an alternative. For its part, DJI says it shouldn't be on the Entity List: A representative tells PCMag that DJI has done nothing to warrant our inclusion on the Entity List. There are a few other brands you can explore. The Autel Robotics Evo drone family is a good alternative. Autel is also a Chinese firm, but the US government hasn't singled it out in the same manner as DJI. Its Evo Nano series competes with DJI Mini drones, and larger Evo Lite drones match up with DJI Air models in size and capabilities. You pay a bit more for Autel on average and its drones aren't quite as finely polished, but the company's models have proven capable in testing. France-based Parrot offers the , another good folding drone; it's a solid option for consumers wary of buying tech from Chinese firms. Unfortunately, it's difficult to find it in stock. Skydio is another company to consider. The company runs out of California and its drones are made for adventurers who want automatic tracking. They help you get aerials without a camera operator but aren't as suitable for cinematography as DJI's drones. Sony sells the , a big bird that works with Alpha mirrorless cameras and compact cinema models like the FX3. It's meant for the most demanding photographers and moviemakers—the drone starts at $9,000 and then you need to spend a couple thousand dollars on a camera and gimbal. For a long time, the DJI Phantom series was about as small as you could go if you wanted to get a full-featured drone that maintains stability in the air and includes strong safety features. That's no longer the case. Hikers and travel photographers appreciate a small, light kit, and they can now get a drone that fits into a backpack. Of course, not every small drone is a top flyer. Some are barely capable of getting off the ground and require you to use your smartphone as a remote control, which makes for a sloppy flying experience. Make sure you get one with a real remote. The DJI Mini 3 is so light that you don't have to pay the FAA registration fee to fly it, and it offers strong video and image quality. It drops some higher-end video features, though, and doesn't offer any sort of obstacle detection. The Mini 3 Pro adds obstacle sensors and comes in under registration weight with its standard battery—though we recommend you fork up the $5 FAA fee and use the drone with its longer-lasting (but heavier) extended runtime battery. You also have to register the Avata, but we consider it a small drone, and it's a good choice if you care more about FPV action than cinematic video. The is a modest update to the we reviewed a couple of years ago. It has all the same basic features but adds antennas for stronger communication and a higher-capacity battery. The price has decreased too (from $1,349 to $1,099 for the basic kit), though you need to budget more if you want the package with a remote control and extra flight batteries. The Ryze Tello isn't a good drone for videographers, but Scratch programming support makes it an appealing first drone for teens learning to code. The DJI Inspire 2 should appeal to professional cinematographers, news organizations, and independent filmmakers. And it's priced as such—it retails at $3,000 and doesn't even include a camera. Our is based on the discontinued Zenmuse X4S camera configuration. If you're buying the drone today, you can get it with the Zenmuse X5S for use with swappable or the X7S to use with DJI's proprietary Super35mm lens system. If you want a smaller drone with high-end video specs, think about a version of the Mavic 3, which starts at $1,600. All versions of the Mavic 3 support 5.1K50 recording with a Four Thirds format camera in 10-bit HEVC. The standard and Cine editions add a telephoto camera, missing from the Classic. On the high end, the Mavic 3 Cine ($5,000) also adds support for ProRes 422 HQ and includes 1TB of onboard storage. The Cine is a worthwhile splurge for cinematographers—the upgraded video toolkit and bundled Pro RC remote justify the cost. DJI offers Matrice drones for industry and enterprise, as well as Agras drones for agriculture. As mentioned earlier, Sony's Airpeak S1 can carry big cameras, but it's close to the Inspire series in size—welcome news for location work.

The salesman Riley is how all salesmen should be. He did not approach me in the typical salesmanship fashion one sees at a car dealership. He was very easy to talk to and down to earth, engaging and even provided some personal information about himself. His demeanor quickly put me at ease as his approach was not pushy but very relaxed, which was refreshing. Riley understood my needs and was quick to accommodate me with whatever I wanted, even if it were not buying the vehicle at all. Riley even answered a question I had after I got home and after the dealership was closed, and also clarified the answer with his supervisor so he could give me the best most informed answer. He was extremely receptive and attentive. Riley also put me in contact with an Insurance company as I was having difficulty getting commercial insurance as the vehicle was bought through my company, however my Insurance company stopped insuring commercial vehicles. I can say with the utmost confidence, if you are in the market for a new Jeep, a new Genesis, or a new Hyundai, or a used vehicle, please go see Riley. You will immediately see how smooth he can make the car buying process. Daniel D. It doesn’t keep track of multiple accounts very well. I have several different email accounts for different businesses and put my personal and I have them all logged in yet it won’t sync doesn’t show locations or places visited properly. For example, I have two iPhones an iPad and a MacBook the MacBook has all accounts signed in one phone has one business in my personal. The other has my other business and my personal. I carry all devices with me most days oh and an iPad, which sometimes has my wife logged in. But just say I take one phone, the MacBook and iPad with me and I go 4 places. Well, one phone and it’s not just one particular phone that does this some days is the iPhone 14 some days it’s the iPhone 13 mini some days it’s the MacBook some days it’s the iPad That will not show any locations I’ve been. and then sometimes it’ll say I’ve been in other states that I have never even visited. I mean, shouldn’t it show on all devices as long as I’m logged in on all devices with the same settings shouldn’t everything be the same if I go to McDonald’s four times in a day which I do not by the way but if I did shouldn’t it show that all my devices show that I went to McDonald’s four times along with the date and time, but it doesn’t. Again it’s hit or miss some days. It all worked out lol then for a month it may not work in an every other day at my work and then once a week it may work or so y’all really need to get that fixed. It’s alright. Buggy sometimes even with good signal. When I search along the route it will sometimes not come up with any search results, only for me to pass the very thing I searched for prior in my drive. And no it wasn’t a new business, it had been around for years. Also when I search places, one will say it’s 10 minutes out of the way while the other says only a few. Only to realize that the faster one ended up not being as simple as they said, and that the slower one (+10 minutes) was only slow because for some reason it had me take side roads completely around it before arriving, when I could have simply turned directly into it from the road I was on, making it a quick trip. Not all gas stations show up in searches, it almost seems to favor the expensive gas stations. There’s doesn’t seem to be an algorithm that keeps track of the bad traffic times. It will re rout my whole trip to a significantly slower route if it senses traffic, even if that traffic is close to the end of my trip hours away and will be cleared well before I get to that point. If you’re a contractor that has to go in and out of many neighborhoods, it normally recognizes certain entrances while not recognizing others, so it will take you completely around the neighborhood 30 minutes away to the other entrance when you have just passed a perfectly good entrance that has been around forever.

        "html_text": " Google Maps is a platform and consumer application offered by Google. It offers , , street maps, 360° views of streets ( ), real-time traffic conditions, and for traveling by foot, car, bike, air (in ) and . As of 2020 , Google Maps was being used by over one billion people every month around the world. Google Maps began as a desktop program developed by brothers and at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and a real-time traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's utilizes , , and . Google Maps offers an that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites, and offers a locator for businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March 2017. However, crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps were not discontinued as the company announced those features would be transferred to the Google Local Guides program. Google Maps' satellite view is a top-down or ; most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 800 to 1,500 feet (240 to 460 m), while most other imagery is from satellites. Much of the available satellite imagery is no more than three years old and is updated on a regular basis, according to a 2011 report. Google Maps previously used of the , and therefore could not accurately show areas around the poles. In August 2018, the desktop version of Google Maps was updated to show a 3D globe. It is still possible to switch back to the 2D map in the settings. Google Maps for and devices was released in September 2008 and features along with dedicated assistance features. By 2013, it was found to be the world's most popular app, with over 54% of global smartphone owners using it. In 2017, the app was reported to have two billion users on Android, along with several other Google services including YouTube, , , , and . Google Maps first started as a program designed by two Danish brothers, and , and Noel Gordon and Stephen Ma, at Sydney-based Where 2 Technologies. It was first designed to be separately downloaded by users, but the company later pitched the idea for a purely Web-based product to Google management, changing the method of distribution. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google Inc. where it transformed into the web application Google Maps. In the same month, Google acquired , a geospatial data visualization company (with investment from the ), whose marquee application suite, Earth Viewer, emerged as the highly successful application in 2005 while other aspects of its core technology were integrated into Google Maps. In September 2004, Google acquired ZipDash, a company that provided realtime traffic analysis. The launch of Google Maps was first announced on the Google Blog on February 8, 2005. In September 2005, in the aftermath of , Google Maps quickly updated its satellite imagery of to allow users to view the extent of the flooding in various parts of that city. As of 2007, Google Maps is equipped with a miniature view with a draggable rectangle that denotes the area shown in the main viewport, and Info windows for previewing details about locations on maps. On November 28, 2007, Google Maps for Mobile 2.0 was released. It featured a of a My Location feature, which uses the GPS / location of the mobile device, if available, supplemented by determining the nearest and . The software looks up the location of the cell site using a database of known wireless networks and sites. By the different signal strengths from cell transmitters and then using their location property (retrieved from the database), My Location determines the user's current location. On September 23, 2008, coinciding with the announcement of the , Google announced that a Google Maps app had been released for its Android operating system. In October 2009, Google replaced as their primary supplier of geospatial data in the US version of Maps and used their own data. On April 19, 2011, Map Maker was added to the American version of Google Maps, allowing any viewer to edit and add changes to Google Maps. This provides Google with local map updates almost in real-time instead of waiting for digital map data companies to release more infrequent updates. On January 31, 2012, Google, due to offering its Maps for free, was found guilty of abusing the dominant position of its Google Maps application and ordered by a court to pay a fine and damages to Bottin Cartographer, a French mapping company.

The API currently does not contain ads, but Google states in their terms of use that they reserve the right to display ads in the future. By using the Google Maps , it is possible to embed Google Maps into an external website, onto which site-specific data can be overlaid. Although initially only a API, the Maps API was expanded to include an API for applications (but this has been deprecated), a service for retrieving static map images, and for performing , generating driving directions, and obtaining elevation profiles. Over 1,000,000 web sites use the Google Maps API, making it the most heavily used web application development API. In September 2011, Google announced it would deprecate the Google Maps API for Flash. The Google Maps API was free for commercial use, provided that the site on which it is being used is publicly accessible and did not charge for access, and was not generating more than 25,000 map accesses a day. Sites that did not meet these requirements could purchase the Google Maps API for Business. As of June 21, 2018, Google increased the prices of the Maps API and requires a billing profile.

Frontier alignments also present some differences between google. cn /maps and google. com /maps. On the latter, sections of the Chinese border with India and Pakistan are shown with dotted lines, indicating areas or frontiers in dispute. However, google. cn shows the Chinese frontier strictly according to Chinese claims with no dotted lines indicating the border with India and Pakistan. For example, the region claimed by China but administered by India as a large part of is shown inside the Chinese frontier by google. cn , with Indian highways ending abruptly at the Chinese claim line. Google. cn also shows Taiwan and the as part of China. Google Ditu's street map coverage of Taiwan no longer omits major state organs, such as the Presidential Palace, the , and the Supreme Court. Feature-wise, google. cn /maps does not feature My Maps. On the other hand, while google. cn displays virtually all text in Chinese, google. com /maps displays most text (user-selectable real text as well as those on map) in English.

The criteria for choosing which language is displayed are not known publicly. There are cases where Google Maps had added out-of-date neighborhood monikers. Thus, in Los Angeles, the name Brooklyn Heights was revived from its 1870s usage and Silver Lake Heights from its 1920s usage, or mistakenly renamed areas (in Detroit, the neighborhood Fiskhorn became Fishkorn). Because many companies utilize Google Maps data, these previously obscure or incorrect names then gain traction; the names are often used by , hotels, sites, , and . Google has said it created its maps from third-party data, public sources, satellites, and users, but many names used have not been connected to any official record. According a former Google Maps employee (who was not authorized to speak publicly), users can submit changes to Google Maps, but some submissions are ruled upon by people with little local knowledge of a place, such as contractors in India. Critics maintain that names likes BoCoCa (for the area in Brooklyn between Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens), are just plain puzzling or simply made up. Some names used by Google have been traced to non-professionally made maps with typographical errors that survived on Google Maps.

This release brings bug fixes that improve our product to help you discover new places and navigate to them. 5.1M Ratings I must say that my experience at Global Auto Mall (Jeep) was absolutely wonderful. The salesman Riley is how all salesmen should be. He did not approach me in the typical salesmanship fashion one sees at a car dealership. He was very easy to talk to and down to earth, engaging and even provided some personal information about himself. His demeanor quickly put me at ease as his approach was not pushy but very relaxed, which was refreshing. Riley understood my needs and was quick to accommodate me with whatever I wanted, even if it were not buying the vehicle at all. Riley even answered a question I had after I got home and after the dealership was closed, and also clarified the answer with his supervisor so he could give me the best most informed answer. He was extremely receptive and attentive. Riley also put me in contact with an Insurance company as I was having difficulty getting commercial insurance as the vehicle was bought through my company, however my Insurance company stopped insuring commercial vehicles. I can say with the utmost confidence, if you are in the market for a new Jeep, a new Genesis, or a new Hyundai, or a used vehicle, please go see Riley. You will immediately see how smooth he can make the car buying process. Daniel D. It doesn’t keep track of multiple accounts very well. I have several different email accounts for different businesses and put my personal and I have them all logged in yet it won’t sync doesn’t show locations or places visited properly. For example, I have two iPhones an iPad and a MacBook the MacBook has all accounts signed in one phone has one business in my personal. The other has my other business and my personal. I carry all devices with me most days oh and an iPad, which sometimes has my wife logged in. But just say I take one phone, the MacBook and iPad with me and I go 4 places. Well, one phone and it’s not just one particular phone that does this some days is the iPhone 14 some days it’s the iPhone 13 mini some days it’s the MacBook some days it’s the iPad That will not show any locations I’ve been. and then sometimes it’ll say I’ve been in other states that I have never even visited. I mean, shouldn’t it show on all devices as long as I’m logged in on all devices with the same settings shouldn’t everything be the same if I go to McDonald’s four times in a day which I do not by the way but if I did shouldn’t it show that all my devices show that I went to McDonald’s four times along with the date and time, but it doesn’t. Again it’s hit or miss some days. It all worked out lol then for a month it may not work in an every other day at my work and then once a week it may work or so y’all really need to get that fixed. It’s alright. Buggy sometimes even with good signal. When I search along the route it will sometimes not come up with any search results, only for me to pass the very thing I searched for prior in my drive. And no it wasn’t a new business, it had been around for years. Also when I search places, one will say it’s 10 minutes out of the way while the other says only a few. Only to realize that the faster one ended up not being as simple as they said, and that the slower one (+10 minutes) was only slow because for some reason it had me take side roads completely around it before arriving, when I could have simply turned directly into it from the road I was on, making it a quick trip. Not all gas stations show up in searches, it almost seems to favor the expensive gas stations. There’s doesn’t seem to be an algorithm that keeps track of the bad traffic times. It will re rout my whole trip to a significantly slower route if it senses traffic, even if that traffic is close to the end of my trip hours away and will be cleared well before I get to that point. If you’re a contractor that has to go in and out of many neighborhoods, it normally recognizes certain entrances while not recognizing others, so it will take you completely around the neighborhood 30 minutes away to the other entrance when you have just passed a perfectly good entrance that has been around forever.

I’ve been at PCMag since 2011 and have covered the surveillance state, vaccination cards, ghost guns, voting, ISIS, art, fashion, film, design, gender bias, and more. You might have seen me on TV talking about these topics or heard me on your commute home on the radio or a podcast. Or maybe you’ve just seen . has changed how we navigate the world. Its desktop and mobile apps have become more than just a way to get from point A to B via car, public transportation, or on foot: The ubiquitous Google service is also a geospatial search engine for the world around us. Google continues to revamp and improve its map product, but there are a ton of customizable tools and hidden functions already baked into Google Maps that you may not know about, such as Incognito Mode. Check out our tips for how to maximize your Google Maps power. You can get an , if that street is in London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, San Francisco, or Tokyo. Open Maps, click the camera icon at the top, and hold your phone up to scan your location. You'll get an overlay of all the places you'd see on Maps, so you can easily find restaurants, shops, and more. Search with Live View will soon be available in Amsterdam, Dublin, Florence, and Venice as well. Google Maps isn't just for the great outdoors. You can navigate through malls, airports, and other big buildings by finding the location in Maps, clicking on it, then scrolling to Directory. You'll never get lost looking for a Cinnabon again. Some places even support Live view inside: and animated arrows to direct you in malls in Chicago, Long Island, Los Angeles, Newark, San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle; and in airports, malls, and transit stations in Tokyo and Zurich. It will soon be available in 1,000 new airports, train stations, and malls in Barcelona, Berlin, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Melbourne, Paris, Prague, São Paulo, Singapore, Sydney, and Taipei. To use the feature, open Maps and click on the camera icon. Rarely do car trips consist of going from point A to B; more often, they are something like A-to-café-to-library-to-Joe's-house-to-B. Thankfully, Google makes it possible to anticipate real trips. To add multiple destinations in the Google Maps mobile app, enter your starting point and your ultimate destination, and then click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner. This prompts a pop-over menu with the option to Add stop. Click that, and you can create a route with multiple stops. You can even drag and drop stops within your itinerary. (Note that this doesn't work when you're using the mass-transit option.) When you're driving, Google lets you choose what kind of car shows up on your navigation in the iOS and Android apps. In the app, plug in your destination and start up driving directions. Tap the icon that shows your current location, and a pop-up menu appears with several car-icon options: a sedan, a pickup truck, or an SUV. You might want to interact with Maps while you're driving, but you don't want to take your eyes off the road. With OK Google in the Google Maps Android app, you don't have to. For example, if you notice you're running low on gas, say OK Google, find gas stations, and it will show gas stations on the map (which you can look at when you've come to a red light or pulled over). You can also ask questions like What's my next turn?, What's my ETA?, and How's traffic ahead? On Android, , and you're good to go. (You'll need a phone running Android Version 9.0 or higher with 4GB RAM or more.) On iOS (pictured above), tap the microphone icon at the top-right, then ask your questions via voice. Today, Maps is most useful on mobile, which brings up a problem: When you're in need of Maps, you may find yourself somewhere with limited (or— gasp —nonexistent) coverage. To help, Google Maps supports offline access. Type in an address or area, swipe up on the menu at the bottom of the screen, tap the ellipsis icon, and select Download offline map . If you have enough storage on your device, the map in question will be saved. To access it later, tap your avatar > Offline maps , and you can then get information about businesses in the region and turn-by-turn directions within the downloaded section. When finding directions on the desktop version of Maps, you can maneuver your route to go through or away from specific locations via drag and drop. Just click and drag any part of your route to move around (this only works with directions for walking, driving, or biking—it won't work with any mass transit options). To get to where you're going, you can type in your destination address—but you can also right-click where you're going on the map, which prompts a pull-down list that you can use to find directions to or from that location. Using the aforementioned right-click tool, you can also calculate the distance of any two points on Earth. Choose Measure distance, which will drop a point (a white dot with a bold black line), then click anywhere else on the map, and the distance between the points is calculated. Keep clicking to add more points on the map; the total trip distance is calculated in the main card. If you shop at Kroger or any of , you can order online, get status updates on your order, share your ETA when you're on the way to pick it up, and check in when you've arrived with Google Maps. Just click on the link in your order email to add it to Google Maps, then visit the app to see all the info. See that little yellow person in the bottom right-hand corner of Google Maps on the desktop? That's Peg Man (or alternatively, the Pegman). You can pick Peg Man up and drop it anywhere on maps to enter into that location's Street View. Peg Man will be oriented with the current view in the embedded map window in the bottom-left corner. Ride-sharing services are a big part of the modern transportation mix, so Google ride options from companies such as Lyft (sorry, ) to its mobile app. Once you enter your destination, tap the little figure attempting to hail a taxi or the mass-transit option. You'll then be presented with nearby rideshare options, along with the estimated time of arrival and fare. Tap Open App to book your ride. Those with mobility issues can search for wheelchair-accessible transit routes by tapping Options > Wheelchair accessible when looking for train or bus directions. When you get to your destination, meanwhile, the Accessible Places setting offers up wheelchair-accessibility information about that location. Turn it on via Settings > Accessibility > Accessible Places . When Accessible Places is switched on, a wheelchair icon will indicate an accessible entrance, and you’ll be able to see if a place has accessible seating, restrooms, or parking, . If it’s confirmed that a place does not have an accessible entrance, we’ll show that information on Maps as well. Remember when the Seinfeld gang spent the whole half hour ? That episode (along with many others) would not work in 2023, thanks to Google Maps. At your destination, tap the blue location dot, and select Save parking , which adds a label to the Maps app identifying where you parked. On Android, tap that to add details such as the parking garage level and spot or the amount of time left before a meter expires. You can also set meter reminders, add a photo of where you parked, and send your parking location to friends. To find it later, tap the search bar at the top, and select Parking location (Android) or Saved parking (iOS). Or tap the Driving arrow below, and look for Saved parking on iOS. To delete, tap You parked here on the map and select Clear (iOS) or More info > Clear (Android). Google Maps can provide turn-by-turn directions based on live-ish traffic data, but it can also provide you with a glimpse of the parking situation. When you search for driving directions to a location on iOS or Android, you might see a P logo at the bottom of the screen along with one of three designations: limited, medium, and easy (plus On-site for retailers with large parking lots). This can help you decide how much time you'll need to allocate for parking or even whether another form of transportation would be a better option. Google maintains a very detailed record of your digital activities. If you'd rather it lose your Maps data, on desktop or mobile. On a desktop, go to . Click the hamburger menu, and select Your data in Maps . You'll end up on a page titled Google-wide Controls, where you can go to Location History > See & delete activity . You'll see a map with a timeline of your activity. On the bottom-right of the map, click the trashcan icon to delete all your location history permanently. To periodically auto-delete your history, navigate to . Click Location History > Choose an auto-delete option , and choose how often Google will delete your data (every 3, 18, or 36 months). On mobile, go to Settings > Maps History , which will bring you to a Maps Activity page. Look for the Delete drop-down menu, where you can opt to delete your history from today, all time, or a custom range. Tap Auto-delete to select a timeframe for when Google will automatically delete Maps data For a quick way to poke around Google Maps without leaving any obvious footprints, go Incognito. Google Maps won't save your browser or search history in your account or send notifications. Your searches and movements won't be added to location history or shared location. And Google won't use your activity while you're in Incognito Mode to personalize Maps. This mode has advantages when you want to peep a location without having it tangled up with your search history, but just as on web browsers, it . To turn the mode on, tap your avatar and select Turn on Incognito mode ; the Incognito icon appears in the search bar. Tap it and select Turn off Incognito mode to switch it off. Google Maps lets you share your current location with people for specified periods of time. When you share your location with a certain contact, they'll see your icon moving in real time on their map. On mobile, tap your profile icon on the top right, and select Location sharing . Then choose with whom you want to share and for how long. Street View has amassed a huge collection of street imagery over the years. In 2014, Google introduced , a way for users to see how Street View has changed over time. Access this four-dimensional cartographic experience in Street View by clicking the little stopwatch icon (when it's available) in the top-left corner of a map on the desktop, which prompts a sliding scale that allows you to jump through Street Views over time. (For a deeper dive on changes to the Earth's surface between 1994 and 2018, check out .) If you've always got Google Maps navigation open while you're driving (or walking), you can to your trip without leaving the app. Sync music apps such as or Apple Music by opening the menu and navigating to Settings . On iOS, tap Navigation > Music playback controls to connect Apple Music or Spotify. On Android, tap Navigation settings > Assistant default media provider , where you can link a number of , including YouTube Music, Spotify, Apple Music, iHeartRadio, Pandora, and Deezer. Once you do, a pop-up to your app of choice should appear as you're driving for a quick tap to get your music started. Be sure to create your playlists beforehand so you can keep your eyes on the road! More and more (EVs) are taking to the road, and Google Maps is adapting. You can search EV charging or EV charging station in Google Maps, and it suggests the best station for you based on traffic conditions, your charge level, and the expected energy consumption. You can filter by types of plugs, and if you're in a rush, you can select Fast Charge to find the charging stations with the most voltage. Want to make sure that next road trip is fuel-efficient? Turn on in Google Maps and the app will prioritize fuel- or energy-efficiency over other factors like real-time traffic and road conditions. So besides showing you the fastest route, it will also show you the most efficient one, even if they aren't the same, Google says. Go to Settings > Navigation / Navigation settings and toggle Prefer fuel-efficient routes to on. Here, you can also tell Google Maps your engine type: gas, diesel, electric, or hybrid.

When you save a favorite place, tap New List to create a collection (like Thai restaurants in Brooklyn) or add it to an existing collection.

It is illustrated primarily by and published by Orion Children's Books in Britain, and Candlewick Press in America. The series originated as a poem that Kessler was writing about a little girl who lived on a boat but had a big secret; an editor recommended that Kessler turn the poem into a book. The series follows the adventures of thirteen-year-old Emily Windsnap after she discovers that she is half mermaid in the first book and is targeted towards middle grade readers. Emily Windsnap lives aboard a boat with her mother. After years of her mother trying to keep her out of the water, her mother gives Emily permission to take mandatory swim lessons at school when she turns thirteen. Class is going well until Emily dives into the pool and her legs lock together causing her to panic and need to be rescued by her teacher. Later that night Emily investigates this mysterious turn of events by diving into the ocean where she discovers that once her legs lock together they turn into a beautiful mermaid's tail!

That's why we've added a new Diverse Representations section to our reviews that will be rolling out on an ongoing basis. You can help us help kids by The parents' guide to what's in this book. Parents need to know that Liz Kessler's Emily Windsnap series is fun, spirited, and more serious than you'd expect for books about tween mermaids. As Emily discovers her new world as a half-mermaid, half-human, she faces an identity crisis, unsure of who she is and feeling alone among new friends. Readers who are navigating conflicts with their own parents and families might identify with Emily's struggles. When a kid's dad is suddenly back in the picture, it doesn't matter if he's human or merman; kids' feelings of uncertainty and blame are universal. That said, the series is about mermaids, with all the magic, hair brushing, and fancy swimming tricks that entails (pardon the pun). This title has: In the EMILY WINDSNAP series, 12-year-old Emily discovering that she is half-mermaid isn't the biggest moment of her life. That comes when she learns that her father didn't abandon her but was imprisoned by an angry King Neptune deep under the sea. It's a lot for a kid to grasp, but Emily faces it all head on. She makes new mermaid friends but has to learn to live by the rules of the sea, which means she confronts King Neptune and his arbitrary decrees about where mermaids should live and who they can be with. There's surprising depth to this fun series. Sure, when Emily Windsnap makes her first best friend and the two of them practice treasure hunting and hair brushing, it all seems flighty and tweeny. But the stories have great pacing, there are adventures and mysteries that intertwine, vocabulary that can challenge average readers, and lots of giggling. Emily is uncertain about her place in the world, and young readers who feel alone or wonder if their friends are sincere will identify with her emotional roller coaster. Emily's relationship with her parents is likely similar to what many readers are experiencing at their age: both close and distant at the same time, they're still kids but pushing for more independence. Families can talk about how Emily Windsnap sometimes feels being caught between her human and mermaid worlds. What do you think is most difficult for her, and what do you think she likes about her situation? Emily seems confident when she's fighting fierce battles in the sea, but quite the opposite when she's facing conflicts with friends. Have you ever felt both confident and overwhelmed at the same time? What other storied have you read or watched about life under the sea? Four princesses save animals using brains and bravery.

        "html_text": " There's something so special about baking a cake from scratch. (There's a reason a few of our most popular recipes of all time are cakes, after all.) Whether you need a baking project or have something to celebrate, there's a cake recipe calling, from to . Serving a snow-white or the gently spiced you've crafted is a truly wonderful way to share dessert, celebrate an occasion, or simply have a solo moment of delight. These cakes go from classic essentials (think carrot cake and strawberry shortcake) to over-the-top aspirational recipes to grow your repertoire. Gather your cake pans and ingredients and discover Food & Wine's best cake recipes. © Con Poulos Every baker needs a go-to bundt cake recipe. This is the ultimate buttermilk bundt cake, nicely browned on the outside, with a soft, tender crumb. This chocolate cake is on our list of the , and for good reason. The semisweet, creamy frosting hits just the right balance, but longtime F&W test kitchen supervisor Marcia Kiesel said, the original was served right out of the pan, no frosting at all, and that's my favorite way to eat it. A classic carrot cake is a crowd-pleaser and can work in traditional layers, in a loaf pan, or even as cupcakes. Pastry chef Jodi Elliot prepares the ultimate version of the 1970s favorite: moist and not too sweet. The French call pound cake quatre-quarts (four-fourths) because it is made with equal parts flour, sugar, eggs, and butter. Chef Jacques Pépin's mother, aunt, and cousin all have their versions. He likes to fold in candied citrus peels to make a French fruit cake; he also loves plain slices dipped in espresso. 2020 F&W Best New Chef Tavel Bristol-Joseph bakes a perfectly creamy cheesecake, without a water bath and with no risk of a cracked or sunken top, by incorporating whipped cream cheese with heavy cream in the batter. To make the cake properly, you're going to have to burn it. The more caramelized it gets, the sweeter and creamier the batter becomes, intensifying the flavor. Toasty, slightly sweet Maria cookies were an after-school snack staple for pastry chef Paola Velez while growing up in the Bronx. Here, she transforms those beloved cookies into an icebox cake, layered with a sweetly spiced cream filling, topped with luscious dulce de leche, and festooned with strawberries and flowers. © Quentin Bacon Many bundt cakes are dense and buttery, but this one is surprisingly light and incredibly moist under its silky chocolate glaze. Strong-brewed coffee in the batter intensifies the chocolate flavor while balancing the sweetness. This cake is as good as a holiday dessert as it is for Sunday brunch. As it bakes, it develops a sweet, rich sauce at the bottom of the dish. The genius of this layer cake is its extraordinarily crunchy filling, made with almonds, salted peanuts, creamy peanut butter, chocolate, and Rice Krispies. The silky milk chocolate ganache frosting is the finishing touch. Quentin Bacon Many versions of this dessert, made by soaking sponge cake in condensed milk, evaporated milk, and cream, are too sweet and wet. This one from chef Soledad Correa is perfect, with just a hint of cinnamon. Sam German created the mild, dark baking chocolate called Baker's German's Sweet Chocolate in 1852; in the late 1950s, a Dallas newspaper published a recipe for German's Chocolate Cake. The dessert took the South by storm and has been a staple ever since. This super-indulgent version features layers of light chocolate cake and a sweet coconut-pecan frosting. This pound cake is made especially rich by swirling in the chocolate-hazelnut spread Nutella. Serve it with coffee ice cream for an extra-special treat. This pretty cake is moist and buttery, with plenty of sweet and tangy caramelized plums on top. It's great for a festive dessert or weekend treat. © Lucy Schaeffer Just about every restaurant in the U.S. offers a version of this creation from chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. But his supremely rich and chocolaty original is in a class by itself. It might seem complex, but this recipe is actually quite easy to make and ready in under an hour. © Petrina Tinslay Joanne Chang is an expert on all kinds of desserts, from elegant French to homespun American like this classic coconut cake. This killer cheesecake has a light, creamy texture and fantastic crunchy crust made from honey graham crackers and amaretti cookies. Bonus: It's a no-bake recipe. Celebrate any day with a big slice of this super-fun sprinkle cake. Sour cream adds a perfect tangy balance to the easy chocolate frosting — and gives this kid-at-heart cake a delicious grown-up twist. The key to a tender crumb is to cream the sugar and butter longer than you think — at least five minutes — to incorporate plenty of air into the batter. We love a mixture of sprinkles to top the cake for an extra-festive look. This carrot cake from cookbook author Nik Sharma is something special. Chopped pieces of dried apricots and candied orange peels give each slice of cake a spot of unexpected fruit sweetness, while the pistachios add texture to the soft cake, he says. Serve it with a cup of warm tea or coffee to complete the experience. Abby Hocking / Food & Wine This towering cake is made with deep red cake layers and lots of cream cheese frosting. Unsweetened cocoa powder and red food coloring give the cake its signature hue. This floral, honey-inflected strawberry cake from chef Eli Dahlin is his springy take on a sticky toffee pudding. The more holes you poke in the cake, the more the honey syrup will penetrate every last bite. Pastry chef Bronwen Wyatt's rich, elegant cake is perfect for just about any celebration you may have coming your way. You can simply spread the buttercream frosting to cover it, swirling for a little flair, or follow Wyatt's decorating tips by using a pastry bag to form ruffles and squiggles with the buttercream. Top the cake with edible decorations of your choice, such as flowers, fruits, and herbs. Pastry chef Kristin Ferguson prepares this deliciously fruity pineapple upside-down cake in individual ring molds and pairs the mini cakes with homemade buttermilk ice cream. This is the most fabulous chocolate cake that I've ever made, Ina Garten declared when F&W ran her recipe in 2007. The buttermilk keeps the cake moist and light, and the bit of coffee in the cake and frosting keeps the sweetness in check. It doesn't get much easier than strawberry shortcake, but this family-style version I created definitely makes it foolproof, food writer Ben Mims says. Instead of punching out all those small cakes, the dough is pressed into a pan and baked as one giant cake, which is much quicker and less stress-inducing, especially when you want an effortless dessert for a weeknight that truly takes no time at all. This dainty dessert was in vogue in the 1920s for ladies' gatherings. Traditionally made with marshmallow frosting, the cake was famously served to President Truman during a trip to Florida in the 1950s. A traditional part of Mardi Gras for the last 300 years in New Orleans (and beyond), these cakes are more like brioche than 'cake' as we know it, pastry chef and cookbook author Kelly Fields says. The yeast-raised dough is braided, sometimes around various fillings, formed into a ring, and baked. Afterwards, it's topped with green, purple, and gold sugar to represent faith, justice, and power, respectively, a nod to the 'three kings.' A token of some sort, be it a bean or plastic baby, is stuffed randomly inside, and tradition states that whoever gets the slice of king cake with the token has to host the next party! The fruity banana batter is bolstered by browned butter for caramel-like richness that's echoed by the butterscotch notes of brown sugar, F&W Cooks contributor Ann Taylor Pittman says. Chocolate chips make an appearance, too, and even though their role is small, it's impactful — especially if you frost and cut the cake before it's completely cool and the chocolate is still a little gooey. Juicy peaches and nutty almond meal pair up in this summery, vegan take on a classic upside-down cake. The almond meal adds a soft texture to the cake and helps it hold together as the peaches soften and sweeten during baking. Traditional Coca-Cola cake, a staple of the American South, usually comes in the form of a chocolate sheet cake that's doused in a gooey glaze. In her modern-day version, cookbook author Vallery Lomas flips tradition on its head by making a cola-flavored cake with cola-flavored icing. She adds warming spices into the cake, like cinnamon and nutmeg, along with a dash of both orange and lemon zest, deepening the cake's chocolatey, cola-y flavor. Baked Alaska, the meringue-topped and torched layered ice cream cake, is a classic restaurant dessert, often served tableside with a fiery effect. Bring the sweet treat home with this simple step-by-step method that takes advantage of creamy (and customizable) store-bought ice creams and sorbets; an easy, buttery pound cake; and just enough time in the freezer between layers to ensure success. Inspired by German cake recipes from a 13th-century cookbook, chef Alex Hrabovsky and his wife, Reana, developed this gluten-free version using almond and gluten-free flours. With its malty, molasses notes, buckwheat honey gives this cake its signature flavor. Rich, chocolaty, and so very festive, this cake is worthy of a party. Ganache has many applications in pastry, and here chef Paola Velez uses it to make the silky-smooth frosting to top her chocolate cake. If you're making the sprinkles from scratch, remember to start one day ahead so they can dry overnight. Pastry chef Sasha Piligian channels summer vibes to make this epic layer cake. She starts with two flavor-packed components — a tart-sweet Meyer lemon curd for the filling, and a coriander-spiced blueberry jam to flavor and tint her fluffy Swiss meringue buttercream frosting. The addition of beaten egg whites to the batter keeps the lemon chiffon cake layers light and airy. For a final flourish, she embellishes the frosted cake with edible flower petals, mint leaves, pools of glistening jam, fresh berries, and sliced citrus. If you love strawberry shortcake, this inspired icebox dessert is for you. Buttery, rich shortbread cookies make an easy base for the cake, layered with plenty of sliced strawberries and a creamy filling with hints of spicy fresh ginger and sweet maple syrup. A topping of strawberries macerated in maple syrup adds a final burst of berry flavor. Layers of delicate flavors from lemon, honey, and extra-virgin olive oi­l — which helps keep the cake moist and imparts mild fruitiness — come together in this one-bowl batter. Stacked with a fluffy and rich lemon–cream cheese frosting, this easy layer cake is a keeper. Be sure the butter and cream cheese are softened for the smoothest frosting. © Ryan Liebe This one is for chocolate lovers. Pastry star Gale Gand layers her phenomenal, high-rising cake with an intensely chocolaty custard and coats it with cake crumbs. Bûche de Noël is the ultimate winter celebration cake, and this one is a cut above the rest. Mascarpone stabilizes the whipped cream filling so that it can be chilled overnight without weeping. Slivered toasted almonds stirred into the ganache frosting give it a “tree bark” look and add contrasting texture to the silky filling and tender cake. Meringue mushrooms add an extra wow factor; these can be made a few days ahead. The meringue topping expands as this stunning cake bakes, so be careful not to spread it all the way to the edges of the cake batter — this will make it easier to remove the cake from the pan. Top with whatever berries are in season at your market, or use your favorite sliced stone fruit. Jennifer Causey / Food Styling by Ali Ramee / Prop Styling by Christina Daley Creamy bananas and spiced rum-brown sugar caramel come together for both the filling and the topping in this cheesecake mashup. The cinnamon-scented buttery crust doubles down on nutty flavor by using both pecan sandies and pecans. The cheesecake is made extra silky with the addition of sour cream, but the real flavor magic happens thanks to vanilla and more spiced rum. Known as kouign amann, this classic cake from Brittany is made with bread dough and butter and has a caramelized sugar top. This easy version, prepared with store-bought bread dough or pizza dough, has been adapted from Home Baking .

        "html_text": "Vanessa Greaves is a Senior Editor at Allrecipes with nearly two decades of experience helping home cooks gain confidence in the kitchen. A self-taught cook who grew up reading cookbooks for fun, Vanessa lives and breathes the challenges faced by busy everyday cooks to get dinner on the table. Describing something as a piece of cake, means that it's really easy. Well, making a cake might be easy for an experienced baker, but if you're just starting out it can be daunting. To help you gain a little experience with cake-baking, I've pulled together 15 easy cakes that beginners can make.

Now you can have your cake and eat it, too. You'll need only seven everyday ingredients to make this easy, versatile recipe, which you can use to bake a 9x9 cake or a dozen cupcakes.

Home cook lonnarific increased the cocoa to one full cup, and says it's the magic amount. Give it the finishing touch with your choice of . This easy cake was made popular during the Great Depression, most likely because you don't need eggs, butter, or milk to make it. You can follow the recipe directions to mix and bake in the same pan, but if you want to remove the cake from the pan before serving, you should mix the batter in a bowl and pour it into a greased, floured, and lined cake pan. This easy cake uses a carton of yogurt as the measuring cup for the ingredients, and is ready in under an hour. Recipe creator Diana Moutsopolous says, Try adding your favorite flavors or additions. A great one is 1/2 yogurt container mini chocolate chips! You could use lemon yogurt and add lemon zest for a lemon yogurt cake. The possibilities are endless! If you use a flavored and sweetened yogurt instead of plain, consider reducing the added sugar to 1 yogurt container. You don't need a stand mixer to make this easy coffee cake.

I used the end of a wooden spoon to poke the holes in the cake and only used about 3/4 of the liquid. I didn't use all the coconut the recipe called for either...just enough to cover the top well. This was very easy to prepare, says RITKA15. The cake looked very lumpy and I thought that there were too many apples but it made the cake very moist and tasty. Was great warm but even better the next day. CeruleanMoon says, This cake came out moist and delicious and didn't taste like a 'cake mix' cake. I left out the orange flavoring in the frosting though and just used vanilla extract instead. Judy calls her creation an easy no-bake sweet treat. Perfect for those hot summer months when turning the oven on is unbearable. Buzz Buzzard Jr. says you should reserve the drained pineapple juice and use it to coat the sliced bananas to prevent them from turning brown. You can whip up the easy batter for this cake, pop it into the fridge overnight, and bake it in the morning. Reviewer lutzflcat says, What a treat it was to wake up, turn on the oven, pop in this coffee cake, and then have a house smelling like cinnamon. This festive cake comes together easily with the help of a few shortcut ingredients. Kim Alexander gave this a 5-star rating, saying, Easy-to-follow recipe and the cake turned out perfect! The cake was also super moist with the added addition of the pudding. It has been years since making a Pineapple Upside-Down Cake and the first time making it in a Bundt pan, so I was a bit nervous.

        "html_text": " The Four Agreements by Miguel Ruiz shares an interesting take on how we perceive the dream instead of reality and how to change that. Last update on 2022-07-16 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Get The Four Agreements audiobook: Get the Kindle version: Get the Paperback version: Don Miguel is a renowned spiritual teacher. He teaches ancient Toltec wisdom that he studied under Toltec. Toltec is mythological, but don claims that he has combined with modern science with common sense. Besides this book, he has also given some other popular titles like: Over 12 million copies have been sold internationally in 46 languages, according to his website. I read many books on philosophy. My first book by Don Miguel Ruiz was The Voice Of Knowledge. In fact, the very first video on my YouTube channel is the summary of that book. Miguel always seems obsessed about building heaven on earth, which is one of the things I like about him. Well, I haven’t met him personally. And I don’t agree with all his ideas. I think he is legit, as learning wisdom takes time. His books are philosophically deep. I can relate his concepts with some of my favorite books on philosophy. In this book summary, I’ll share 7 best lessons that I learned from this book. So without further ado, let’s dive right in. Best Tools for Bibliophiles What if I tell you that you are dreaming someone else’s dream right now? You might not agree, right? But this is precisely what happens with all of us, according to the author. Almost all of our beliefs and thoughts come from other people. From the moment we are born and start to understand the world around us, our parents teach us all they can. They tell us what to eat and what not to eat, as well as what to believe and what not to believe. Of course, they do it to prepare us for the chaotic world we live in. As we become teenagers, we make friends and engage with society. Society has its own rules. It tells us what to think and believe. It tells us what is praiseworthy and what is abominable. It reveals which aspirations are worth pursuing. Not only that, but it also tells us what “success” must look like to us when almost everyone is uncertain about life and still trying to figure it out. The problem? We are conditioned to accept the opinions of others. Although other people might have good intentions, but still, it’s their perspective. You don’t learn very early on when to say no to false ideas. We learn to accept the views of others without expressing our own opinion. Heck, many of those opinions shape our thoughts and self-perception. It influences our perception of the world. The agreements we make in childhood have a lasting impact on our adult lives. The question is : Do we ever get to choose anything? We may think we know ourselves, but in reality, we don’t. And that’s why we agree to stuff that doesn’t help us in the long term. It could anything: a bad idea, a bad opinion, a faulty concept, a bad goal, a wrong definition of an important word, etc. We often make poor decisions, which lead to further suffering. Allow me to explain. Who suffers the most on this planet? It’s us. Don’t believe me? Just think about it. Look at any species on the planet. As long as they eat, sleep, and pro-create, they are content. Have you ever seen any animal other than humans searching for the meaning of life and striving for happiness? We don’t find that, right? Animals don’t think as much as humans do. We have a strong memory that records all our actions and experiences. We have concepts of karma. Humans are the only species capable of believing in supernatural phenomena that have no basis in reality. We have morals that guide us and tell us what is right and what is wrong. We cannot view the world without our biases and preconceived notions. The positive aspect is : As long we are grounded in reality, we can prevent suffering. But since many of us lack self-awareness, we continue to suffer without understanding the cause. Most people follow rules without understanding why they exist. For instance, many people adhere to diets and rituals without grasping their significance. Many people choose careers without first considering their motivations. We often act without thinking clearly, and this leaves us unaware of our own suffering. Don’t worry, in the upcoming lessons we’ll tackle these bigger issues and find solutions. Keep reading. Words have more power than we realize. Every idea you hold is made of words. Thinking is impossible without words in your mind. In this book, the author reminds us that powerful leaders have such a strong influence because their words can sway the masses and have far-reaching consequences. Many of us don’t take notice of the words we hear and say to ourselves. Consequently, we often overlook the impact that other people’s words have on our lives. Think about all the times you have cursed yourself for making silly mistakes. Did it bring any positive result? Probably, not. When we continually use negative words to describe ourselves, we start to believe them and think they reflect reality. How many people give up on their dreams when they are criticized by those who have no understanding? How often have we criticized others simply because we weren’t feeling well? We do this because we lack understanding of how words can shape beliefs, and eventually lead to action. Words are tools we use to communicate with both our inner and outer worlds. When you use words in the correct manner, and uplift yourself through your speech, you begin to create a paradise for yourself. But when you keep complaining about how weak you are and how chaotic the reality is, you create a living hell for yourself. The author suggests to be in love with true self and remind yourself that you can overcome suffering through action. But it doesn’t mean that you have to be in love with your opinions or beliefs. Let’s understand. Do you know why people take opinions so seriously, even though they are wrong most of the time? Most people get offended easily if you say something against their ideas. This happens because they take it personally. What happens when we take something personally? We attach our sense of Self with the idea in question. That’s why we feel bad when someone doesn’t agree with our opinions. The same thing happens when we hear someone’s opinions about ourselves. We never learn how to distance ourselves from our ideas. We think that someone’s opinion must have some kind of truth in it. If this wasn’t enough, we all carry guilt from the past within us, which further multiplies how bad we feel when someone criticizes us. Just remember when someone criticizes you, it’s just an opinion. Put in other words, it’s simply another telling you what they think about you. Kindly note that “What they think about you” can change with time. That’s why you don’t have to believe it every time. You can consider it and evaluate it further. But you have the choice to ignore it as well. Here is the trickiest part : We tend to ignore advice that doesn’t please us. Remember that this rule of questioning opinions applies to both sides. Neither your nor mine or anybody else’s opinions should be considered as truth without questioning. Every opinion is an idea or thought. And it can or must be challenged to realize the truth. We are on to something amazing here. Let’s proceed to the next lesson and dig deeper. Most people don’t see clearly. We all attempt to fit complex concepts into our existing knowledge, even when we lack understanding of them. Whatever we interpret, we do it based on what we already know. Few people take the time to examine the perceived reality. Or in other words, we assume we know the truth. Questioning and clearing assumptions is a time taking process. And without it, you can’t see truth. Because , but observation of reality must take place in the present. When we observe something, let’s say a chair, all the thoughts related to the chair come in our minds. Thoughts just happen. With the knowledge of the past comes interference in the present. When you attempt to interpret something based on your prior knowledge, you introduce bias. You cannot control your thoughts, but you can strive to remove bias from the equation. That is what it means to see without thoughts. This is also how you can stop dreaming and view reality without any assumptions. The thing is : We often fail to recognize the detrimental effects of making assumptions on our daily lives. It doesn’t matter if it’s your relationship, career, or health; living on assumptions gives you a false sense of security that you’re doing the right thing. Have you ever witnessed people ruining their health by taking bad advice? Or have you seen individuals purchasing useless items, believing they would be beneficial? Wrong decisions often stem from incorrect assumptions. Don’t assume anything. Don’t assume that everybody is a good person or bad person. Don’t assume that life is going to linear all the time. Don’t assume that every person is the same. Don’t assume that every job is the same. Don’t assume that every company takes their mission seriously. If you sit down and start listing your assumptions about the world, the list will be lengthy. To avoid making assumptions, ask the right questions. The quality of your questions reflects your intelligence level. Most people don’t ask questions. Know why? They fear that asking questions may cause their dream world of assumptions to collapse. So, they tend to play safe. It’s easy to play safe, isn’t it. Remember, you can play it safe, but someday assumptions will be proven wrong because they aren’t truth. The truth is the only thing that stands the test of time. This lesson is simpler to apply than the previous ones. Just give your best at whatever you do. This may seem simple, yet interestingly, most people do not put their full effort into their work. This happens because of all the problems we discussed above. People often lack clarity about why they are doing a particular job. This leaves them unsure of how much effort to put in. To be fully committed to something, one must have no doubts. The goal must be clear. Now, you may wonder: why should we always strive to give our best? Here is why: We are wrong about so many things in life. It’s only a matter of when we realize that. Many of the things we think we know are merely assumptions. It’s time we wake up and see the dreams we are all living in. What dreams, you may wonder? We all see the world differently based on our beliefs and experiences. The right way is to just see without any preconceived notions. The concepts of right and wrong, the concepts of good and bad, they all prevent us from experiencing reality. And when those rules or concepts are proven wrong, we feel guilty. Remember, any rule is made for us. It’s there to help us live freely and be peaceful. If it’s doing the opposite, we must stop following it blindly and find a solution with scientific temperament. We must also not forget how quickly we can become biased and enticed by attractive objects. In the language of author, we need to break those bad agreements that we made as powerless children. After all, we are not born only to suffer. We can think and progress. We have a choice to become wiser. It’s all about understanding. Not about how much you know. Read the review below and get a copy of this book. Last update on 2022-07-16 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon The book has a total of 7 chapters: The first chapter discussed the idea of how we are all living in our dreams without realizing. From chapter 2 to chapter 6 author gives simple rules to how to live the right way. In the last chapter, the author discusses how heaven is possible on the earth if you just follow the simple rules discussed in the previous chapters. The four agreements of life are : 1. Be impeccable with your words. 2. Don’t take anything personally. 3. Always do your best. 4. Don’t make assumptions. The purpose of four agreements is to help you live a richer and meaningful life. The four agreements taught me that I have said “yes” to so many things in life that I forgot to say “no.” The four agreements are easy to apply in almost any area of life. For example, you can always give your best despite how difficult a task or a situation is. The dream of the planet consists of all the concepts that we commonly agree on without speaking explicitly. The parasite is other people’s opinions that we carry throughout our lives without investigating them. To be impeccable with our word simply means that we don’t use our words to create more suffering for us as well as others. You can teach your children by the four agreements by playing games. For example, give a task to your children, and ask them to give their best without worrying about failure. Reward them even if they fail. Don’t scold them too much when they get less grades in an exam. Teach them that they can always improve. Yes, the author is a spiritual teacher and spreads Toltec wisdom through his books.

It’s as simple as that. Follow these basic instructions to bake your bacon and make cleanup a breeze. I love bacon. I especially love perfectly crispy bacon If you follow me on , you definitely already know that. If it’s not crispy I am not interested. And you probably also know that I catch a lot of flack for posting bacon as frequently as I do. I get all kinds of comments like, “good luck with your bacon cancer!” Yikes! Beyond the angry comments I get lots of comments asking me how I make my crispy bacon. The short answer is that I bake it. I never cook it in a unless I know I am going to immediately use the grease for cooking. The long answer is detailed here so that you can also make crispy bacon. I have to give my older brother all of the credit for opening my eyes to the magic of baked bacon. It makes the bacon perfectly crispy every single time. Which is a huge cooking win! The other plus of cooking bacon in the oven is the clean up. When you cook bacon in a pan the grease can splash around and dirty the kitchen. Then you need to find a way to dispose of that grease. I will say that there are times when it is necessary to cook bacon in a pan. I do this for my prep so I can preserve the bacon grease to cook in. If I cook bacon in a , I always cook it slow and low. The other thing I like about making perfectly crispy bacon in the oven is that I can make a big batch for meal prep. During I realized that I could prep bacon ahead of time, store it in the fridge and then heat it up whenever I need it. I like reheating mine in a toaster oven. Since I am baking my bacon I can easily make a full pack of bacon. I sometimes need to space the bacon out in more than one tray. If I am using more than one tray in the oven at a time, I just switch them out half way through cooking. Of course, I usually have my bacon at breakfast time, but if it is prepped and in the fridge I like it at other times of day as well. I like to grab it as a quick snack on the go with some cheese. I also love to have a crispy piece of bacon crumbled over my salads. I use this method every time I cook bacon, but it is particularly useful for meal prep! I just cook the bacon and transfer the strips to a paper towel lined plate. Then I save them in an airtight container in the fridge for the rest of the week. I find clean up to be easier with this method because I catch my grease in my parchment and then toss it in the trash. All I have to do then is rinse out my and I am good to go. Keep reading to find the full instructions and be sure to tag me on in your images of perfectly cooked bacon so I can see them!

Δ Joni says Posted on 12/17 at 8:45 am This feels like such a simple recipe but it is a game changer! I hate frying bacon because of the mess it makes but this was so easy (to make AND to clean up). The bacon was perfectly crispy and delicious! ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Madeline says Posted on 12/17 at 9:21 am amazing!! I am so glad and feel the exact same way. Nalley says Posted on 8/11 at 5:39 pm I work long hours and made this salad with some shortcut steps. I purchased precooked bacon(i like the taste but not smell of bacon cooking) precut broccolli florets, and a rotisserie chicken from the deli. I added diced red onion to the salad and a 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. To the ranch dressing I added to minced garlic cloves and mixed well for added flavor. Mary jane says Posted on 3/5 at 2:20 pm Best bacon ever never to fry again. Have 15 children 35 to 56 so at a brunch that’s one thing we need much of ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Madeline says Posted on 3/6 at 2:10 pm oh yay!! Ashley says Posted on 7/17 at 1:39 pm Wow this was really a game changer! I LOVE bacon. Love it. I grew up with microwaved bacon (don’t judge too harshly please), so I thought my pan-fried bacon was THE way to go. I was wrong. This was so easy to make a bunch at once, I didn’t have to keep watching it to make sure it doesn’t burn. Best of all – it was perfectly crisp and not even a little bit overcooked. This helped me make a batch to use in different recipes throughout the week. I don’t think I’ll go back to any other method after this. Thank you!! ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Madeline says Posted on 7/18 at 8:53 pm YAY!! amazing Sarah says Posted on 11/26 at 1:19 pm Such a time saver when making breakfast for more than one! Bacon comes out so good and just crispy enough.

From breakfast tacos to waffle platters to overstuffed BLTs, a crispy slice of bacon is a peak eating experience. But I'm here to tell you: It could be even crispier. While I was hunting for the simplest possible recipes for my new cookbook, , I stumbled on a trick used by the third-generation stewards of , established in 1962 in Austin. It’s so effective that their customers assume their bacon has been fried, state fair style. “People, it’s not deep-fried,” co-owner Regina Estrada said, as she described her family’s technique for writer Paula Forbes’s , where I first saw it. So what is it that makes Joe’s bacon so incomparably crisp? This trick dates back to Regina’s grandfather, Joe Avila: With a flour coating and an overnight chill, bacon both kept its shape better and stayed crispier in their bean-and-egg tacos. And the shape is important, Regina emailed me: “Always strips of bacon 🥓. Never crumbled.” (Any crumbly bits and bacon grease go into their beans.) At the bakery these days, the kitchen team dredges 15-pound cases of bacon, slice by slice, in all-purpose flour; refrigerates them on a sheet pan overnight; then cooks them on the griddle at around 4 a.m. to use throughout the day. But for beginners and busy cooks at home, the easiest way to evenly cook a batch of bacon is in the oven, right on the same sheet pan. As Southern cooks like my late grandmother Grace could tell you, pretty much everything—and especially proteins like ribs or catfish—is better when coated in seasoned flour, then shallow-fried. was thin slices of pork belly cooked this way, alongside biscuits and gravy. (She lived to be 98, so feel free to consider this a prescription for a long, happy life.) Here’s why: When you douse anything in flour before frying, it jump-starts delicious browning, dries the surface for maximum crisping (and minimal spattering), and protects the ingredient’s exterior. But with an all-in-one ingredient like bacon, which brings its own seasoning and cooking fat to the party, there’s no need to season the flour or fill a pan with oil for frying. You just need high heat and the bacon goes right ahead and fries itself. At Joe’s Bakery, the classic dredge is all-purpose flour, but if you’re serving folks who are gluten-intolerant, or you just want to tinker with other flours and starches in your pantry, they’ll all bring their own personalities to the breaded crunch. Sweet rice flour leaves a delicate, shattering edge. Nuttier whole-grain sorts like rye are more prone toward chew and unmistakably earthier, bringing out the bacon’s smoky vibes. Cornstarch leaves a fine, flaky crunch (just be sure to shake off the excess—it’s a clinger). And like all good bacon, any of these riffs will be the best part of your club sandwich or pancake breakfast—except now, with Joe’s simply genius trick, it will be even better. The night before you want bacon, dip bacon strips (2–3 per person) in a medium bowl of flour to coat completely. Shake off any loose flour and lay the strips on a parchment-paper-lined sheet pan in a single layer (if you need to stack the bacon, lay parchment between each layer), cover the pan with beeswax wrap or a final layer of parchment, and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, heat the oven to 400° and bake the bacon uncovered in a single layer (not stacked) right on the parchment-lined sheet pan(s). When the bacon is starting to brown, about 5 minutes, use tongs to flip the slices over, and continue cooking until the bacon is evenly browned and crispy, about 10 minutes total. With the tongs, move the cooked bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain briefly. Serve warm.

        "html_text": "The scent of sizzling can be detected by humans from a range that would put a bloodhound to shame. It instantly incites a Pavlovian, borderline-pornographic response, flooding your system with endorphins and stimulating the hickory-smoked portion of the brain. The body involuntarily goes into motion, rapidly following its nose to the source of this olfactory magic: the porky pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In a perfect world, you are greeted with a platter of warm coated with the scantest amount of fat, exploding with the flavors of smoke and salt, and ethereally crispy. But this is not a perfect world. There is such a thing as bad bacon, and it is the cruelest of all the devil’s tricks. It can be chewy, , burnt, greasy, or all of those things at once. The realization that you have been tantalized by bad bacon is devastating. The endorphins of joy transform into lightning bolts of white hot rage. This is no way to live. You should never have to settle for bad bacon, and I’m here to help. Forward this to your friends and family who have disappointed you in the past. Print it out and keep a copy in your wallet. Go to Kinko’s and make flyers to post around the neighborhood. This is your bacon bible, which will save mankind from itself. Fat is good, but too much fat is not. Right off the bat, rinse your bacon well with hot water to remove all the congealed excess. Give it a little shake in the sink to remove excess water, then pat dry. Oven: This is quite simply the : no spattering, no burning, minimal shrinkage and best of all, lots of clean rendered fat that you can store in the fridge for a rainy day. Line a sheet pan with a large sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil, then place a roasting rack or wire cooling rack on top of it. Lay out your bacon out on the rack, and don’t worry about leaving any spaces in between, or even overlapping a little bit if you need the room. The bacon shrinks as it cooks, so there’s no need to worry. Roast at 400°F degrees for at least 15 minutes before checking—the exact cooking time will vary depending on how crispy you want your bacon to get. Once it’s done, carefully remove it from the oven and, using tongs, flip the strips over to allow any grease that may have pooled on top to drip off. After you’ve had your way with the bacon, carefully lift up the foil like a sling and pour the liquid fat into a clean jar, because . The water hack: gave the world this “hack” a few years back and it’s a total game changer for you folks who hate turning on the oven. Arrange your bacon strips in the widest pan you have in your kitchen—frying pan, pasta pot, doesn’t matter as long as it’s got a lot of surface area. Pour enough cold water over the bacon to just cover and place over high heat. As the water comes to a boil it will slowly render excess fat from the bacon. Allow it to completely boil off, then reduce heat to medium and fry the bacon in its own grease, flipping often to make sure it cooks evenly. Brick: Cast-iron purists may balk at adding water to their precious pans. If you’re one of them, make your bacon they way they do at the diner by weighing it down on a rocket hot surface. Heat that pan on high for at least three minutes, add your bacon in flat strips, then put a foil lined brick (or two) on top to hold it down. Sprinkle a bit of kosher salt over the non-brick areas, which will help keep the grease from popping out of the pan onto your delicate forearms. Check bacon after two minutes to monitor its progress, flip when you feel it’s ready. If you’ve roasted your bacon there’s no need to worry about this, as all the fat dripped off in the oven. If you’ve cooked it in a pan, you’ll need to wipe off the extra grease. Line a large plate with at least three layers of paper towels—any less will just absorb the bare minimum of fat and keep the bulk of it all over your bacon. Remove the bacon with tongs and let drip dry into the pan for a second, then put right on the paper towels. Once all the bacon is out, put a few more paper towels on top and gently press down using the bottom of a glass, not your hands. Blisters make it hard to eat bacon. "

        "description": "Transformers is a series of science fiction action films based on the Transformers franchise of the Michael Bay directed the first five",
        "html_text": " Transformers is a series of based on the of the 1980s. directed the first five films: (2007), (2009), (2011), (2014), and (2017), and has served as a producer for subsequent films. A sixth film , directed by and produced by Bay, was released on December 21, 2018. A seventh film, , directed by and produced by Bay, is to be released on June 9, 2023. The series has been distributed by , and worked on the first two films. The original Transformers series has received negative to mixed reception, except for Bumblebee , which received positive reviews. It is the , with a total of $4.8 billion; the series' films have generally been successful at the box office, with Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction grossing over $1 billion each. For the film, producer was planning a , but when the U.S. launched the in March 2003, suggested adapting the instead. joined Murphy because he was a fan of the series. They met with comic book writer , and cited the cartoon and comics as their main influence. They made the their , though Murphy had it renamed because of the . DeSanto chose to write the from a human point of view to engage the audience, while Murphy wanted it to have a realistic tone, reminiscent of a . The treatment featured the , Ironhide, , , , Ratchet, Wheeljack, and , and the , , , Ravage, , Rumble, and . , a fan of the comics and toys, signed on as in 2004. wrote the first draft, which pitted four Autobots against four Decepticons, and featured the spaceship. and , fans of the cartoon, were hired to rewrite the script in February 2005. Spielberg suggested that a boy and his car should be the focus. This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of adulthood and responsibility, the things that a car represents in the . The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point of view given in Orci and Kurtzman's first draft. The Transformers had no dialogue, as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous. The writers felt that even if it would look silly, not having the robots speak would betray the fanbase. The first draft also had a battle scene in the . Spielberg read each of Orci and Kurtzman's drafts and gave notes for improvement. The writers remained involved throughout production, adding additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing (although none of this was kept in the final film, which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the initial edit). Furman's The Ultimate Guide , published by , remained as a resource to the writers throughout production. Prime Directive was used as a . This was also the name of ' first . was asked to direct by Spielberg on July 30, 2005, but he dismissed the film as a stupid toy movie. Nonetheless, he wanted to work with Spielberg, and gained a new respect for the mythology upon visiting Hasbro. Bay considered the first draft too kiddie, so he increased the military's role in the story. The writers sought inspiration from G.I. Joe for the soldier characters, being careful not to mix the brands. Because Orci and Kurtzman were concerned the film could feel like a commercial, they chose to make the military believe nations like were behind the Decepticon attack as well as making the Decepticons primarily military vehicles. Bay based Lennox's struggle to get to the Pentagon phone line while struggling with an unhelpful operator from a real account he was given by a soldier when working on another film. Orci and Kurtzman experimented with numerous robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers to form the final cast. Bay acknowledged that most of the Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing the toys. Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked. Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script. was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small. An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped, being used later in the film's sequels. In September 2007, Paramount announced a late June 2009 release date for the sequel to . A major hurdle that was overcome during the film's production was the , as well as possible strikes by the and the . Bay began creating of action sequences featuring characters rejected for the 2007 film; this would allow animators to complete sequences if the went on strike in July 2008, which ultimately did not happen. The director considered making a small project in between Transformers and its sequel, but knew you have your baby and you don't want someone else to take it. The film was given a $200 million budget, which was $50 million more than the 2007 film, and some of the action scenes rejected for the original were written into the sequel, such as the way Optimus is reintroduced in this film. said the studio proposed filming two sequels simultaneously, but he and Bay concurred that was not the right direction for the series. Writers and originally passed on the sequel because of a busy schedule. The studio began courting other writers in May 2007, but as they were unimpressed with their , they convinced Orci and Kurtzman to return. The studio also signed on , as he impressed Bay and Hasbro president with his knowledge of the Transformers mythology, and because he was friends with Orci and Kurtzman. The writing trio were paid $8 million. Screenwriting was interrupted by the , but to avoid production delays the writers spent two weeks writing a , which they handed in the night before the strike began, and Bay expanded the outline into a sixty-page , fleshing out the action, adding more jokes, as well as selecting the majority of new characters. The three writers spent four months finishing the screenplay while locked in two hotel rooms by Bay: Kruger wrote in his own room and the trio would check on each other's work twice a day. Orci described the film's theme as being away from home, with the Autobots contemplating living on Earth as they cannot restore Cybertron, while Sam goes to college. He wanted the focus between the robots and humans much more evenly balanced, the stakes be higher, and the science fiction elements more prominent. said that in total, there are around forty robots in the film, while 's Scott Farrar has said there are actually sixty. Orci added that he wanted to modulate the humor more, and felt he managed the more outrageous jokes by balancing them with a more serious plot approach to the Transformers' mythology. Bay concurred that he wanted to please fans by making the tone darker, and that moms will think its safe enough to bring the kids back out to the movies despite his trademark sense of humor. Before Transformers was released, producer DeSanto had a very cool idea to introduce the Dinobots, while Bay was interested in an , which was dropped from the 2007 film. Orci claimed they did not incorporate these characters into Revenge of the Fallen because they could not think of a way to justify the Dinobots' choice of form, and were unable to fit in the aircraft carrier. Orci also admitted he was also dismissive of the Dinobots because he does not like dinosaurs. I recognize I am weird in that department, he said, but he became fonder of them during filming because of their popularity with fans. He added I couldn't see why a Transformer would feel the need to disguise himself in front of a bunch of lizards. Movie-wise, I mean. Once the general audience is fully on board with the whole thing, maybe Dinobots in the future. However, Michael Bay said he hated the Dinobots and they had never been in consideration for being featured in the movies. It is the last film in the series to be distributed by DreamWorks. For the third film, as a preemptive measure before the release of Revenge of the Fallen , Michael Lucchi and Paramount announced on March 16, 2009, that a third film would be released in on July 1, 2011, which earned a surprised response from director Bay: I said I was taking off a year from Transformers . Paramount made a mistake in dating Transformers 3 —they asked me on the phone—I said yes to July 1—but for 2012—whoops! Not 2011! That would mean I would have to start prep in September. No way. My brain needs a break from fighting robots. Screenwriters and , who had worked on the two previous Transformers films, declined to return for the third film, with Kurtzman declaring that the franchise is so wonderful that it deserves to be fresh, all the time. We just felt like we'd given it a lot and didn't have an insight for where to go with it next. Revenge of the Fallen ' s co-writer became the sole screenwriter for Dark of the Moon . Kruger had frequent meetings with 's (ILM) CGI producers, who suggested plot points such as the scenes in Chernobyl. On October 1, 2009, Bay revealed that Dark of the Moon had already gone into pre-production, and its planned release was back to its originally intended date of July 1, 2011, rather than 2012. Due to the revived interest in technology brought in by the success of , talks between Paramount, ILM, and Bay had considered the possibility of the next Transformers film being filmed in 3-D, and testing was performed to bring the technology into Bay's work. Bay originally was not much interested in the format as he felt it did not fit his aggressive style of filmmaking, but he was convinced after talks with Avatar director , who even offered the technical crew from that film. Cameron reportedly told Bay about 3-D, You gotta look at it as a toy, it's another fun tool to help get emotion and character and create an experience. Bay was reluctant to film with 3-D cameras since in test he found them to be too cumbersome for his filming style, but he did not want to implement the technology in post production either since he was not pleased with the results.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, writing It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset. The second film, Revenge of the Fallen , received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the screenplay and runtime, while praising the visual effects, sound design, action sequences, musical score, performances (particularly LaBeouf, Fox, and Turturro), and voice acting (particularly Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, and Tony Todd). Roger Ebert gave the film one star, calling it a horrible experience of unbearable length, punctuated by three or four amusing moments. The characterization of the Autobot twins, Skids and Mudflap, was heavily criticized. of Rolling Stone magazine labeled them: two of the most offensive bots in screen history...who do black stereotypes in ways that would shame and concluded the film has a shot at the title Worst Movie of the Decade.

Because this film is not quite as stupid as the others...But let's face it, these touches are atypical. After half an hour it turns into the same headbanging, eardrum-brutalising action-fest as the other two films. Bradshaw also notes the impressive effects in the Battle of Chicago at the climax and how the inspired it. of called Dark of the Moon among Michael Bay's best films but said, I can't decide if this movie is so spectacularly, breathtakingly dumb as to induce stupidity in anyone who watches, or so brutally brilliant that it disarms all reason. What's the difference? Scott also criticized the film for continuing the series' pattern of tongue-in-cheek by using the as the catalyst for the film's events. Dan Kois of The Village Voice also criticized Michael Bay's continuation of exploiting America's iconic tragedies for maximum impact.

Desta noted that despite the film's MacGuffin-focused plot, the visual effects remain impressive. of magazine rated the film 2 out of 5 stars. Freer said that like the previous films, it is bogged down in backstory, lacks a real feel for its characters and still can't find a way to make its robot-on-robot action exhilarating... It is amazing how a series with so much nostalgic goodwill, technical finesse and behind the scenes talent have led so often to experiences that are so joyless. The 2018 spin-off film, Bumblebee , received positive reviews from critics, who praised its lighter tone, story, visuals, performances, direction, and faithfulness to the 1980s Transformers show. of The New York Times praised the plot, Christina Hodson's script, and Hailee Steinfeld's performance, calling her possibly the only appealing main human character in the franchise so far. James Dyer of Empire magazine gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, praising aspects such as Travis Knight's directing, the screenplay, Steinfield and John Cena's acting, and the film's '80s nostalgia; he praised the film for acting as a love letter to Steven Spielberg's films.

David Fear of noted the film for borrowing elements from , , and films, and commented: the usual -on-steroids vibe of the Bay movies are M.I.A. , replaced with a less bombastic combination of bot-outta-water shenanigans... and sensitive, not-at-all sappy Y.A. drama. The franchise has been frequently praised and won awards for its sound design. Michael Bay praised the crew and highlighted the importance of sound saying I have like 2,000 people — through their artistry — making my dreams a film, Bay said. The artistry of this sound group is just amazing. I love, love sound. It's 45–50% of the movies. In addition to the films, the film series has a promotional expanded series that is set both before and after the events of the films. This includes comic books, video games, and novels. While the novels are partially based on the films themselves, and the video games are not in the same continuity as the films, the comic books and graphic novels are in the same continuity and fill in several parts of the stories from the films.

Peter is sensitive in a way that doesn’t usually appear in modern media—this shows the reader it is okay to have feelings, and to love others very deeply. While Peter turns his back on nature (which Pax represents) at the beginning of the novel in favor of humanity (which his father represents), by the end of the novel, Peter is more in touch with his animalistic tendencies and ensures the safety of Pax. Peter’s coming-of-age development appears in his encouragement of Vola; his resourcefulness in fixing his crutches and scaring a coyote; and his ability to let Pax move onto a better life, even though Peter doesn’t want to lose Pax. Pax is the story’s secondary protagonist: a fox with incredible loyalty to Peter who doesn’t see humans as the enemy. His very existence helps forge a peace between humans and animals. His role is especially significant, as the name Pax means peace. Pax also undergoes a transformation in the novel that mirrors Peter’s.

Written by people who wish to remain anonymous A boy and his father travel a long distance from their home to release a fox into the forest. The boy, whose name is , found the little fox when it was just a kit, grown attached to it and called it . He clearly doesn’t want to leave the fox behind, but succumbs to his father’s pressure, throws Pax’s favorite toy soldier into the forest and gets into the car to leave. It is further revealed that the father is about to go into the war, and he leaves the boy with his grandfather. At his grandfather’s, Peter suddenly has a rush of anxiety and realizes that it was a big mistake to leave Pax behind. He packs his bag, looks at the map to check where he left Pax, and leaves home to bring his fox back. Meanwhile, Pax is determined to wait for his boy at the same spot he left him. He suddenly discovers that he’s not alone. A female fox joins him, and she berates him for the human smell on him. The female fox, called Bristle, experienced human cruelty and swore to never trust them again. Bristle is accompanied by a smaller fox, her brother called Runt. Runt is eager to be friends with Pax, while Bristle is reluctant. They bring Pax into their hiding place to spend the night with them. On his path to retrieve Pax, Peter is faced with the threats of other people, who will report him as a runaway if not careful. He spends some time hiding on a school playground and manages to escape. He finds himself on a secluded farm and, while following the map directions for a shortcut, falls down and breaks his leg. Far away from Peter, Pax is determined to reunite with his boy. An old gray fox, a pack leader, decides to accompany him south. Gray informs Pax that there is a war coming to their lands. Pax and Gray get attacked by a coyote, and Gray gets severely injured. After Gray dies, Pax returns to his pack to inform them of his death. Peter wakes up in someone’s barn. He meets the owner, a woman called . She helps him with his broken leg. Peter notices that Vola is missing her leg, and she tells him that she lost it in the war. He wants to immediately continue his search, but his leg doesn’t allow him to. He asks Vola for help, and she agrees. Pax goes back to the south, secretly followed by Bristle and Runt. He comes across a war camp, and discovers Peter’s father there. Runt gets injured in an explosion near the war camp and loses one of his paws. Unable to return, Pax, Bristle and Runt stay nearby the camp. Peter and Vola slowly become friends as the time goes by. She reveals to him that she killed a man in war, and was hunted by it ever since. Peter is determined to help Vola return to the human world, he performs a play with her wood puppets that shows her rising from the ashes like a phoenix. Vola is angry at him at first, but then she accepts his conditions to break her isolation before he continues his search for Pax. She helps him by asking her friend bus driver to drive him as close to the place where he left Pax as possible. Meanwhile, Pax and his two foxes get attacked by a group of coyotes, who sensed Runt’s injury. While battling the coyotes, Pax believes to hear his boy calling him. He sees the boy’s father talking to and hugging a boy similar to Peter, but not quite like his boy, which confuses him. Finally, Pax and Peter reunite, and Peter helps them fight off the coyotes. After seeing the other two foxes, Peter realizes that Pax found his place, that he now belongs to them, and throws Pax’s favorite toy soldier into the forest once again.

When Peter’s father volunteers to go to war, Peter must give up the fox he has raised since it was a kit . Peter wars with himself as he feels guilty for abandoning his friend. However, at the same time, he is afraid to stand up to his father’s anger. When he decides to find Pax, Peter goes on a journey to rescue his friend. His mission leads him to recognize and accept his own feelings of anger. Pax and Peter’s story begins when Peter and his father drop Pax off in the woods near an abandoned rope mine.

Bristle, a female fox, hates humans and blames them for the destruction of her family. Her younger brother Runt tries to befriend Pax even though his sister warns him away from the strange fox. Gray, the elder fox in the area, takes Pax under his wing because he had spent time with humans just like Pax. Peter is unhappy with his grandfather because the man has the same anger in him that Peter sees in his father. Peter does his best to deny his own anger. It was because he had gotten angry and broken his mother’s gazing globe that he had not been allowed to go grocery shopping with her on the day she had her fatal car accident. Since that time he had sworn to himself that he would not allow himself to get angry. Peter feels he has slighted his responsibility to Pax, so he decides to go back to the spot where he left Pax and take him home. Peter quickly has trouble on his trip when he falls and breaks his foot. He is taken in by a war veteran who believes she is too dangerous to be around people because she killed a man during the war.

Meanwhile Pax makes friends with and gains the trust of the other foxes. Together he and Bristle have nursed Runt back to health after he lost a hind leg when a land mine exploded.

Subdivisions of the hot, dry region include the and deserts. The Sonoran Desert has a subtropical climate and receives 3 to 15 inches (75 to 380 mm) of rain per year. Most of it falls during the monsoon season (July–September), when strong, brief thunderstorms bring heavy rain. Lighter winter rainfall occurs in December and January. Frosts are rare. The hottest and driest part of the is near the lower , where summer temperatures can reach more than 120 °F (49 °C) and rainfall is less than three inches. The vegetation of the Sonoran is the most of all the North American deserts. In addition to the , the signature of the desert, common types include the , , , cholla, , yucca, , ironwood, , elephant tree, mesquite, and creosote bush; to Baja California are the cardon (up to 60 feet in height, a relative of the saguaro) and the unusual (known in as the cirio). Thorn forest occurs in southern Baja and Sonora. Higher elevations support trees adapted to more-temperate climates. Desert , , collared peccaries (commonly known as javelinas), mountain lions, gray foxes, and coyotes make their homes in the desert. Other typical residents include desert tortoises, Gila monsters, tarantulas, scorpions, and a variety of lizards and snakes. Rabbits and rodents, such as jackrabbits and kangaroo rats, are abundant, as are several species of bats. Birds include roadrunners, Gila woodpeckers, Gambel’s , and a variety of owls and hawks. Peoples of the were early inhabitants of the desert. Spanish explorers and missionaries visited in the 16th and 17th centuries, and missions and settlements often conflicted with local tribes during the 18th century. Ranching and mining began in the 19th century. Military facilities opened during . Tribes such as the Tohono O’odham ( ), , , and several peoples hold reservations throughout the desert. Irrigation has produced many fertile agricultural areas, notably the and valleys at either end of the . The population of the Sonoran Desert is rapidly growing; during the last decades of the 20th century the region became a major retirement and resort spot. Arizona’s largest cities ( and ) are located there, and , California, is on its northwestern edge. The Sonoran Desert has several areas of public land, including and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge on the Mexican border, near Tucson, southeast of Phoenix, and part of in California. El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar, a biosphere in Sonora on the U.S. border, is an area of lava fields, cinder cones, and volcanic craters. Sonoran Desert National Monument, established in 2001, preserves 760 square miles (1,970 square km) southwest of Phoenix. Within its borders are three mountain ranges, wide valleys, and saguaro forests. The endangered Sonoran pronghorn makes its home there, as do more than 200 species of birds. Hohokam archaeological sites are scattered throughout. Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail passes through the monument. "

Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument , large desert area in southwestern , U.S. It is situated along the Mexican border, its northern boundary about 15 miles (24 km) south of by road. The cities of (northwest) and (east-northeast) lie about 140 and 185 miles (225 and 300 km), respectively, from the monument. Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge adjoins the monument to the west and northwest, and the Indian Reservation bounds it to the east. Established in 1937, it was a by in 1976. The monument, with an area of 517 square miles (1,339 square km), preserves segments of the rugged . It is named for the ( Stenocereus thurberi ), which is found in large stands in the only in this locality and is so called because its branches resemble organ pipes. Park headquarters and a visitor’s centre are located in the southeastern portion of the monument, about 5 miles (8 km) north of the border town (within the monument) of Lukeville. The region’s landscape consists of several ranges of mountains and hills interspersed with broad and relatively flat valleys. The relief rises to its highest elevations in the Ajo Range along the eastern boundary, reaching 4,808 feet (1,465 metres) at Mount Ajo. A small, permanent, spring-fed pond is located at Quitobaquito in the southwest corner of the national monument; otherwise there are no waterways. However, several streams within the boundaries can quickly become raging torrents during and after the often intense thunderstorms that occur during the summer monsoon period (July–September). Winters are cool and pleasant, with high temperatures in the 60s F (about 18 °C), lows of about 40 °F (4 °C), and frequent light rain showers. Springs and early summers are dry, with high temperatures climbing as the days progress toward summer. Summers are hot, and the air becomes more humid during the monsoon. High temperatures exceed 100 °F (38 °C) on most days from June through August. In addition to organ-pipe , numerous other desert plants are found in the monument, including desert ironwoods, ocotillos (flowering spiny shrubs), saguaros (large candelabra-shaped cacti), creosote bushes, and the rare elephant tree ( Bursera microphylla ). In years when there is adequate rainfall during the winter and early spring, wildflowers bloom profusely between February and April. Typical mammals include desert , javelinas, coyotes, a variety of rodents (notably kangaroo rats), and the endangered Sonoran pronghorn (a type of antelope); the occasional puma (mountain lion) may also be sighted. Among the numerous birds that can be seen in the monument are northern cardinals, Gila woodpeckers, cactus wrens, and several species of hummingbirds. Common reptiles include desert tortoises, chuckwallas, venomous , and several species of rattlesnakes. Scorpions, tarantulas and other desert spiders, and the endangered Quitobaquito pupfish ( Cyprinodon eremus ) are among the smaller creatures found there. The monument is accessible via a north-south road that bisects its eastern portion before continuing on into from Lukeville. Facilities are minimal, with no restaurants, service stations, or (other than camping) available within the monument. Most visitors come during the cooler winter months. Driving or cycling on the scenic drives and hiking to historic sites (e.g., former ranches and mines) are popular activities. A portion of El Camino del Diablo (“Devil’s Highway”), the historic Spanish route along which hundreds of miners and pioneers lost their lives, crosses a corner of the monument and can still be traveled by four-wheel-drive vehicles.

In 1976 the monument was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, and in 1977 95% of Organ Pipe Cactus was declared a . Land for the Monument was donated by the Arizona state legislature to the federal government during Prohibition knowing that the north–south road would be improved and make contraband alcohol easier to import from Mexico. In 1937 the land was officially opened as a national monument. At the north entrance of the park is the unincorporated community of ; the town of at the park's southern border is a border crossing point to , Sonora, Mexico. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is bordered to the northwest by and to the east by the . The visitor center has been named in honor of Ranger Kris Eggle.

After being considered the most dangerous national park, the park reopened the backcountry after surveillance towers, vehicle barriers, and pedestrian fences were installed along the border. The first 30-foot (9.1 m) panels of a new Arizona, US-Mexico border wall were installed in August 2019 on a two-mile (3.2 km) stretch of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. It is the first of three projects that will add bollard walls along Southern Arizona's wildlife refuges. The issued a report on September 18, 2019, stating that the barrier wall threatens archaeological artifacts representing 16,000 years of human history. The agency said that five archaeological sites fall within the area that it wishes to construct. In February 2020, controlled demolition and other construction work was performed within the . This strip of land along is federally controlled. However, many sites within this region are considered sacred by the . Important sites include Monument Hill, which is a ceremonial and historic battle site and burial ground; and , which is a local water source and the site of an annual salt pilgrimage. For this reason, construction was opposed by many locals, including Representative and Tohono O’odham Nation Chairman Ned Norris, Jr., who testified before Congress on the matter. Customs and Border Protection officials maintained that no human remains or artifacts were discovered in the areas where explosives were used, and that Monument Hill was previously disturbed in 2010 when the existing border fence was installed.

        "html_text": "The Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is a US National Monument and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve located in the southern region of the state of . There are 16 named mountains in the monument, the tallest and most prominent of which is (4,816 ft/1,468m). Located in southern , along the / border, the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument protects about 330,880 acres of the vast Sonoran Desert. The monument is one of many protected areas located within the , a series of mountain systems that stretch across the southwestern , including portions of , , , and , as well as the states of and in northwestern . Elevations in the monument range from about 980 feet (299 m) to over 4,800 feet (1,463 m) at the summit of , the highest peak in the park. Prominent mountain ranges in the monument include: the Ajo Range, Puerto Blanco Mountains, , , , and Sonoyta Mountains. The Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is bordered to the east by the and to the west/northwest by the and . Much of the monument’s northern boundary abuts private land and federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). South of the monument, in , the protects an additional 1,765,731 acres (714,566 ha) of the Sonoran Desert, including a volcanic system known as Santa Clara and the Pinacate Peaks, a group of volcanic peaks and cinder cones. About 95% of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (300,000 acres/121,406 ha), is designated as the Organ Pipe Cactus Wilderness. The Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is located in the Basin and Range Province, a region characterized by narrow, alternating, north-south trending mountain ranges and intervening basin valleys. Typical of the Basin and Range province, the Organ Pipe Cactus features wide alluvial basins separated by steep mountain ranges. Much of the area has been shaped by extensive faulting and volcanic activity. One of the most unique geological features of the monument is the Pinacate volcanic field, a 55 by 60 km (34 mi by 37 mi) volcanic field that stretches across northern , and into southern . Pinacate features a large shield volcano and numerous maars, tuff rings, and cinder cones of late-Pleistocene to Holocene age. The oldest rocks in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument are believed to be 1.8 to 1.6-billion-year-old gneisses and granites exposed in the . These rocks, along with 1.4-billion-year-old granites found in the , represent periods of continental crust formation and mountain building. At the northern edge of the monument, near Growler Pass, 550 to 330-million-year-old (Cambrian, Devonian, and Mississippian) quartzite, schist, and marble evidence a period of deposition of sediment in shallow seas. Between 180 to 145 million years ago (Jurassic time), the region saw several episodes of tectonic and volcanic activity, producing the volcanic and granitic rocks of the Puerto Blanco Mountains, , and . The current landscape really began to take shape about 30 to 24 million years ago, in the middle Tertiary, when the Earth’s crust was stretched in an east-west direction, producing large, tilted blocks. Another period of extensive faulting, 15 to 10 million years ago, uplifted mountain ranges and lowered valleys, shaping the region’s present-day Basin and Range topography. As recent as just 11,000 years ago, eruptions of lava produced cinder cones and basalt flows in the Pinacate volcanic field. The Pinacate volcanic field is still considered to be an active volcanic field. The Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is one of the most biologically diverse areas of the Sonoran Desert. An International Biosphere Reserve, the monument provides habitat for wide variety of flora and fauna, including threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant and animal species. The Monument contains five vegetation habitat types: mixed Sonoran Desert shrub, creosote-bursage, evergreen woodland/mesic evergreen scrubland, marsh and open water, and riparian communities. Though summer temperatures in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument can reach an astonishing 120 degrees Fahrenheit, about 31 species of cactus have learned to thrive in this unforgiving Sonoran Desert climate. Cacti species found in the monument include the saguaro, senita, chain fruit cholla, teddy bear cholla, Arizona barrell, and Engelmann’s prickly pear, among others. Most notably, the monument protects about 90% of the population of organ pipe cactus. In the early summer months, this rare, multi-spined cactus reveals beautiful lavender-white flowers after the sun goes down. The Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is also one of the few places in the where elephant trees are found. Though cacti in the monument often tower over the trees, small trees and shrubs are widespread. Common tree and shrub species include creosote, brittlebush, jojoba, palo verde, mesquite, ironwood, ocotillo, and elephant tree. The Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument protects many animal species, including bat, mountain lion, desert bighorn sheep, Sonoran pronghorn, kangaroo rat, packrat, coyote, and jackrabbit, among others. The monument lies along a primary migratory flyway and more than 270 bird species take advantage of the desert’s seasonal flowers, fruits, and warm winters. Common bird species found in the monument include the Cactus Wren, Curve-Billed Thrasher, Gila Woodpecker, Common Raven, Phainopepla, Northern Cardinal, Costa’s Hummingbirds, Roadrunner, and Elf Owl. A wide variety of desert reptiles, some of which are unique to the Sonoran Desert, thrive in the monument. Reptile species include Gila Monster, Desert Tortoise, Chuckwalla, Tree Lizard, Gopher Snake, and Rattlesnakes. The land now occupied by Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument has been home to humans for approximately 15,000-years. The earliest inhabitants were likely the Hohokam, whose ancient trade routes bisect the monument, evidencing centuries of movement and trade across the Sonoran Desert. Often revered as one of the greatest of the ancient southwest cultures, the Hohokam are credited for the creation of irrigation canals fed by the Salt and Gila Rivers. Remnants of these canals, which once supported fields of corn, beans, squash, tobacco, and cotton, can still be observed throughout the monument today. It's estimated that the Hohokam dispersed into Tohono O’odham and Hia Ced O’odham cultures around CE 1450. Less than a century later, in 1540, the first Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area, claiming as part of “New Spain.” When the Spanish arrived in the Sonoran Desert, the Tohono O’odham Nation, descendants of the Hohokam, inhabited much of southern and Northern , as well as parts of the Gulf of California. Throughout the 17 th and 18 th centuries, the Spanish established missions in the area to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity. Missions were often responsible for the introduction and spread of deadly disease, as well as violence and forced labor. Since the early 18 th century, several foreign governments have occupied the ancestral lands of the O’odham people. In 1821, gained independence from Spain and Arizona became part of Mexico’s Alta California territory. Just over two decades later, in 1848, succeeded more than half of its territory, including the area north of the Gila River in , to the . However, the land now occupied by the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument was still part of until 1853, when the US purchased the land south of the Gila River to build the Southern Pacific Railroad route. By this time, gold fever had already drawn thousands of hopeful prospectors west and mineral mining operations were established throughout the Sonoran Desert. Ranching and mining quickly became the leading industries in the area. Though the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument was established in 1937, mineral mining was prevalent in the area throughout the mid to late 19 th Century and continued until 1976, when the monument became an International Biosphere Reserve and subsequently received wilderness designation. There are many miles of trail in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Generally, the park is separated into two main areas – the Ajo Range and Puerto Blanco Mountains. Two scenic roads, the Ajo Mountain Drive and Puerto Blanco Drive, lead to miles of hiking trails varying in difficulty. The 21-mile (34 km) Ajo Mountain Drive is a graded, one-way dirt road that travels towards the foothills of the Ajo Range, a craggy ridge that forms the eastern boundary of the monument. Along the way, visitors will travel through a varied desert landscape surrounded by imposing volcanic peaks. There are also several trails along the route, allowing visitors to further explore this unique desert landscape. These are some of the most popular trails in the area: Arguably the most popular destination in the monument, Arch Canyon is an easy, relatively flat 1.2-mile (1.9 km) trail that leads to a set of beautiful rhyolite arches. In addition to the arches, the Arch Canyon trail highlights the area’s unique topography and vegetation. In the spring, it’s not uncommon to see many wildflowers blooming amidst cacti, shrubs, and grasses in the area. Rated as moderate, the Estes Canyon trail traverses through the Ajo Range. From the trailhead, hikers will follow a rocky, single-track trail, surrounded by many species of cacti and a variety of desert plants, including saguaros, chain fruit chollas, teddy bear chollas, and Engelmann’s prickly pear. Halfway around the loop, hikers can opt to take a strenuous spur trail to Bull Pasture, which boasts incredible views of , the highest peak in the monument. The Puerto Blanco Mountains lie in the southeast region of the Organ Pipe Cactus Monument. One of the most scenic drives in the area, the Puerto Blanco Drive, traverses through cactus plains and mountain foothills in this region. Along this route, a series of developed trails lead to historic mines and artifacts, as well highlight the area’s unique ecology. These are some of the hiking trails in the Puerto Blanco Mountains region: Beginning in the 1890s, the Victoria Mine was the site of gold and silver mining in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument region. Peak mining activity occurred between the 1890s and 1910s, but continued sporadically until 1976, when the monument was designated a wilderness area. The 4.4-mile (7 km) trail to Victoria Mine begins near the Twin Peaks Campground and features old mining artifacts from the region’s once-robust silver and gold operations. Hikers can continue an additional 4 miles (6.4 km), round trip, to explore the Lost Cabin, another primitive stone mining house tucked in the Puerto Blanco Mountains. Located on the south side of the Puerto Blanco Mountains, the Senita Basin trail is an easy, 2.9-mile (4.7 km) loop trail that allows visitors to explore one of the most impressive groves of senita cacti in the area. The lush Senita Basin also sustains other columnar cacti, including saguaro and organ pipes. One of the best times to visit this area is between April and August, when beautiful pale pink flowers bloom from the upper stems of the senita cacti. Looking for a place to stay during your trip to the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument? Here are some of the best cities to check out: Located about 120 miles (193 km) east of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is the city of Tucson, Arizona’s second-largest city. Tucson is best-known for being home to the University of Arizona, but it’s also centrally located to a variety of recreation opportunities including the Butterfly Peak Natural Area, Catalina State Park, Sabino Canyon Recreation Area, , and the . The anchor of Arizona’s Phoenix metropolitan area, Phoenix, is home to over 1.6 million residents, making it one of the most populated cities in the US. The city’s warm, dry climate makes it a particularly popular destination for tourists looking to escape the snow and cold during winter months. In addition to offering visitors a wide variety of shopping, dining, resort, and hotel options, Phoenix is also located near many acres of wilderness. This sprawling metropolis is surrounded by impressive mountain ranges, including the , , , South Mountains, and the Sierra Estrella. Additionally, the forms part of the city’s northeast boundary. "

        "html_text": "Alisa Reznick/KJZZ In the human-made pond at Quitobaquito Springs, a volunteer uses a plastic bucket to move pupfish and mudturtles out of the pond in preparation for a new lining. Nestled in a thicket of mesquite and cottonwood trees, Quitobaquito Springs is an exception in a stretch of Sonoran Desert that’s infamously dry. It’s been flowing for more than 10,000 years. For millennia, it sustained communities of Hia C-eḍ Oʼodham, a tribe with ancestral land in Arizona and Sonora, and served as a homestead and thoroughfare for many others. Today, it’s part of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument along the U.S.-Mexico border. The human-made pond it drains into is about half the size of a football field; it’s been here since the 1800s. But Danny Martin, Organ Pipe’s wildlife program manager, says a clay lining installed in the pond in the 1960s is failing now. Water is slowly seeping out. Alisa Reznick/KJZZDanny Martin holds a young male mud turtle relocated from Quitobaquito's pond to a temporary holding tank. “Our intent here is to try and preserve this little oasis ecosystem for as long as we can,” he says. Making sure water stays here is vital. This pond is home to the Sonoyta mud turtle and the Quitobaquito pupfish, two desert creatures who live on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Their only wild U.S. habitat is here. Martin says relining the pond is their best chance of long-term survival. But they have to drain the water — temporarily — to do it. That’s what brought more than two dozen people from government agencies and the Tohono O’odham Nation to the park this spring. They’re trying to get the turtles and pupfish out of the water so the relining project can get started. This is a big, delicate operation for two tiny animals. Pupfish grow to be roughly two inches long. Mud turtles are about the size of your palm. Volunteers are dragging a giant, weighted fishing net through the pond called a seine, trying to scoop the animals up from the sediment at the bottom of the murky water. Alisa Reznick/KJZZVolunteers use a special fishing net called a seine to collect and remove aquatic animals from the pond at Quitobaquito. Monitors estimate only about 150 turtles and around 10,000 pupfish are here. Martin and his team are using traps, nets, and even hand-digging through the mud, trying to get them all out safely. Small refuge pools built on site house the turtles and fish temporarily. Workers carry bucketloads of the animals to the new pools and throw grass, logs and other natural materials in with them, so they can build new habitats while the relining work is completed. Meanwhile, a pump sucks water out of the pond and empties it into a natural wash nearby. Fresh spring water that normally feeds the pond through an old cement channel is also being diverted for now. Alisa Reznick/KJZZA young mud turtle is curled up inside its shell. Martin says all of this is prepping the pond to have its old clay lining removed and replaced with a thick plastic one. Organ Pipe managers hope it will last longer. It’s a race to save the site from the effects of climate change. “With climate change, we’re getting hotter temperatures and more severe, frequent droughts,” Martin says. They’re also making other adjustments, like deepening the pond to reduce evaporation and keeping the refuge pools in place, so the turtles and pupfish have more space. Alisa Reznick/KJZZThe project includes a series of new refuge pools, or sediment traps, that will stay intact at the mouth of the pond to increase space for the turtles and pupfish at Quitobaquito. This area has already gone through big changes. Around this time in 2020, construction workers were building the Trump administration’s 30-foot steel bollard border wall in Organ Pipe. Today, the finished wall, and the gleam of stadium lights installed with it, are visible from Quitobaquito. During wall construction, Eleanor Ortega was coming to Organ Pipe to see the changes up close. She’s Hia C-eḍ Oʼodham and a member of the Tohono O’odham Nation nearby. Her family lived at Quitobaquito before it became part of Organ Pipe in the 1950s. “And ... the bigger wildlife that got stuck on the other side of the wall, where are they getting their water now? Because this was their watering hole,” she says. “This wall did a lot of damage.” Alisa Reznick/KJZZHia C-eḍ Oʼodham cousins (from left) Lorraine Marquez Eiler, Daniel Ortega and Eleanor Ortega pose for a portrait at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Ortega came here with her grandpa as a kid. As an adult, she’s watched turtles pop out from the water’s surface at the sound of traditional O’odham singing during ceremonies. Seeing the new lining project today, she’s not sure what to make of it. “This is going to be the last time I see it (the pond) like this,” she says. “Next time it’s going to be different… They say it’s going to be a good thing…I hope it is.” Still, Ortega says she’s trying to trust the work. All told, the new lining project will cost around $475,000. Ortega’s cousin, Lorraine Marquez Eiler, helped raise about $100,000 for it through an organization she’s part of in nearby Ajo called the International Sonoran Desert Alliance. Alisa Reznick/KJZZEleanor Ortega watches remediation construction taking place at Quitobaquito's pond. Ortega's relatives used to live at the site. Eiler is a Hia C-eḍ Oʼodham elder and historian who, like Ortega, is a member of the Tohono O'odham Nation. As a teenager, she says she was told Hia C-ed O'odham didn't exist anymore. The tribe is related to the Tohono O'odham, but isn't recognized by the U.S. government. She’s spent most of her life challenging those fallacies, and protecting Hia C-eḍ Oʼodham sites like Quitobaquito. Now, at 86, she says she’s seen a lot of different changes here — some good, others, not so much. “I’m here, here I am,” she says. “I don’t represent the tribe, I don’t represent anybody, except myself, my family and my descendants, and the area we used to live in.” She wants to make sure people like her are also part of the site’s future. Contractors work on building sediment traps above Quitobaquito's pond.

Three major plant associations of the Sonoran desert are represented in the area: the Arizona upland with saguaro cactus (Cereus giganteus), paloverde (Cercidium spp.) and organ pipe cactus; the California microphyll with creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and bursage (Ambrosia spp.); and floristic components normally associated with the Mexican Gulf coast association elephant tree (Bursera microphylla) and senita cactus (Cereus thurberi). There are some desert riparian and relict oak woodlands. 49 native mammals occur within the monument, including the endangered Sonoran pronghorn (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis). he entire area, with the exception of the upper parts of the mountains, has been modified by cattle grazing in the past. This activity is thought to have originated in 1699 and continued until 1978, when the remaining livestock were removed. Though the extent of modification is mostly unquantified, it has resulted in visible soil erosion and some floral species composition changes. Organ Pipe Cactus is part of the International Sonoran Desert Alliance (ISDA) which includes citizens, native Americans, business leaders and organizations of the United States and Mexico (including the Alto Golfo de California Biosphere Reserve) which are concerned with the western Sonoran Desert. ISDA has developed several culturally and environmentally focused community-based activities. Last updated: June 2019 UNESCO applies a zero tolerance policy against all forms of harassment "

Subdivisions of the hot, dry region include the and deserts. The Sonoran Desert has a subtropical climate and receives 3 to 15 inches (75 to 380 mm) of rain per year. Most of it falls during the monsoon season (July–September), when strong, brief thunderstorms bring heavy rain. Lighter winter rainfall occurs in December and January. Frosts are rare. The hottest and driest part of the is near the lower , where summer temperatures can reach more than 120 °F (49 °C) and rainfall is less than three inches. The vegetation of the Sonoran is the most of all the North American deserts. In addition to the , the signature of the desert, common types include the , , , cholla, , yucca, , ironwood, , elephant tree, mesquite, and creosote bush; to Baja California are the cardon (up to 60 feet in height, a relative of the saguaro) and the unusual (known in as the cirio). Thorn forest occurs in southern Baja and Sonora. Higher elevations support trees adapted to more-temperate climates. Desert , , collared peccaries (commonly known as javelinas), mountain lions, gray foxes, and coyotes make their homes in the desert. Other typical residents include desert tortoises, Gila monsters, tarantulas, scorpions, and a variety of lizards and snakes. Rabbits and rodents, such as jackrabbits and kangaroo rats, are abundant, as are several species of bats. Birds include roadrunners, Gila woodpeckers, Gambel’s , and a variety of owls and hawks. Peoples of the were early inhabitants of the desert. Spanish explorers and missionaries visited in the 16th and 17th centuries, and missions and settlements often conflicted with local tribes during the 18th century. Ranching and mining began in the 19th century. Military facilities opened during . Tribes such as the Tohono O’odham ( ), , , and several peoples hold reservations throughout the desert. Irrigation has produced many fertile agricultural areas, notably the and valleys at either end of the . The population of the Sonoran Desert is rapidly growing; during the last decades of the 20th century the region became a major retirement and resort spot. Arizona’s largest cities ( and ) are located there, and , California, is on its northwestern edge.

It is the hottest desert in both Mexico and the United States. It has an area of 260,000 square kilometers (100,000 sq mi). In , the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran of the of southwestern North America, part of the of the northern . The desert contains a variety of unique and , notably, the ( Carnegiea gigantea ) and ( Stenocereus thurberi ). The Sonoran Desert is clearly distinct from nearby deserts (e.g., the , , and ) because it provides subtropical warmth in winter and two seasons of rainfall (in contrast, for example, to the Mojave's dry summers and cold winters). This creates an extreme contrast between aridity and moisture. The Sonoran desert wraps around the northern end of the , from ( in central and Pacific west coast, Central Gulf Coast subregion on east to southern tip), north through much of , excluding the central northwest mountains and Pacific west coast, through southeastern California and southwestern and southern Arizona to western and central parts of . It is bounded on the west by the , which separate it from the (northwest) and (Vizcaino subregion, central and southeast) ecoregions of the Pacific slope. The ecoregion lies south of the Sonoran desert on the Gulf of California slope of the Baja California Peninsula. To the north in California and northwest Arizona, the Sonoran Desert transitions to the colder-winter, higher-elevation , , and deserts. The are to the northeast. The and are at higher elevations to the east. To the south the is the transition zone from the Sonoran Desert to the of the Mexican state of . The desert's sub-regions include the of southeastern California; and the east of the north-to-south section of the in southwest Arizona. In the 1957 publication Vegetation of the Sonoran Desert , Forrest Shreve divided the Sonoran Desert into seven regions according to characteristic vegetation: Lower Colorado Valley, Arizona Upland, Plains of Sonora, Foothills of Sonora, Central Gulf Coast, Vizcaíno Region, and Magdalena Region. Many ecologists consider Shreve's Vizcaíno and Magdalena regions, which lie on the western side of the , to be a separate , the . Within the southern Sonoran Desert in Mexico is found the , with the , extending 2,000 square kilometers (770 sq mi) of desert and mountainous regions. The biosphere reserve includes the only active dune region in North America. The nearest city to the biosphere reserve is ('Rocky Point') in the state of , . Sonoran Desert sub-regions include: The Sonoran desert has an arid subtropical climate. In the lower-elevation portions of the desert, temperatures are warm year-round, and rainfall is infrequent and irregular, often less than 90 mm (approx. 3.5”) annually. The Arizona uplands are also warm year-round, but they receive 100–300 mm (approx. 4-12”) of average annual rainfall, which falls in a more regular bi-seasonal pattern. Many plants not only survive, but thrive in the harsh conditions of the Sonoran Desert. Many have evolved to have specialized adaptations to the desert climate. The Sonoran Desert's bi-seasonal rainfall pattern results in more plant species than any other desert in the world. The Sonoran Desert includes plant genera and species from the family, family, family, family, and numerous others. The Sonoran is the only place in the world where the famous ( Carnegiea gigantea ) grows in the wild. ( Cylindropuntia spp.), ( Opuntia basilaris ), ( Echinocereus spp.), ( Ferocactus wislizeni ), ( Opuntia spp.), ( Peniocereus spp.), and ( Stenocereus thurberi ) are other taxa of cacti found here. Cactus provides food and homes to many desert mammals and birds, with showy flowers in reds, pinks, yellows, and whites, blooming most commonly from late March through June, depending on the species and seasonal temperatures. ( Larrea tridentata ) and ( Ambrosia dumosa ) dominate valley floors. ( Psorothamnus fremontii ) and are other shrubs that may be found. include ( Abronia villosa ), ( Geraea canescens ), and . Ascending from the valley up , various subtrees such as ( Prosopis velutina ), ( Parkinsonia florida ), ( Olneya tesota ), ( Chilopsis linearis ssp. arcuata ), and ( Canotia holacantha ) are common, as well as multi-stemmed ( Fouquieria splendens ). Shrubs found at higher elevations include ( Acacia constricta ), fairy duster, and . In the desert subdivisions found on Baja California, cardon cactus, elephant tree, and occur. The ( Washingtonia filifera ) is found in the section of the Sonoran Desert, the only palm in California, among many other introduced genera and species. It is found at -fed , such as in , , and the . The Sonoran Desert is home to a wide variety of animals, birds and other creatures. such as the , , , , , , , and . There are three hundred fifty bird species, 20 amphibian species, over 100 reptile species, 30 native fish species, over 1000 native bee species, and more than 2,000 native plant species found in the desert area. The Sonoran Desert area southeast of and near the Mexican border is vital habitat for the only population of living within the United States. The was once an ecological hotspot within the Sonoran desert due to the Colorado river in this otherwise dry area, but the delta has been greatly reduced in extent due to the damming and use of the river upstream. Species that have higher heat tolerance are able to thrive in the conditions of the Sonoran Desert. One such insect species that has evolved a means to thrive in this environment is , a Sonoran Desert fly. This fly contains a specialized detoxification system that enables it to nest in the cool region of exudate moistened soil. Thus, the fly is one of few that can tolerate the high desert temperatures and successfully reproduce. in , Mexico in , United States in , United States in , Mexico in , United States in , United States The Sonoran Desert is home to the cultures of over 17 contemporary tribes, with settlements at and , as well as populations in Mexico.

Safford and Benson in Arizona are located in low elevations of the western edges of the Chihuahuan Desert, but in an ecotone with the . According to the the Chihuahuan Desert may be the most biologically diverse desert in the world as measured by species richness or endemism. The region has been badly degraded, mainly due to grazing. Many native grasses and other species have become dominated by woody native plants, including creosote bush and mesquite, due to and other urbanization. The , once abundant, was nearly extinct and remains on the endangered species list. The desert is mainly a desert because the two main mountain ranges which bound the desert, the to the west and the to the east, block most moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, respectively. Climatically, the desert mostly has an arid, mesothermal climate with one rainy season in the late summer and smaller amounts of precipitation in early winter, the mean daily temperature of the coldest month warmer than 0 °C (32 °F). The majority of rain falls between late June and early October during the when moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Sea of Cortez penetrates into the region, or much less frequently, when a tropical cyclone moves inland and stalls. Owing to its inland position and higher elevation than the to the west, mostly varying from 480 to 1,800 m (1,575 to 5,906 ft) in elevation, the desert has a slightly milder climate in the summer (though usually daytime June temperatures are in the range of 32 to 40 °C or 90 to 104 °F), with mild to cool winters and occasional to frequent freezes. The hottest temperatures in the desert occur in lower elevation areas and valleys, including near the Rio Grande from south of El Paso into the Big Bend, and the Bolson de Mapimi. A subtropical temperature regime describes lower elevations in the Texas Big Bend region up to the Presidio and Candelaria areas, then southward into similar elevations, while a warm temperate temperature regime describes higher elevations and further north. The average annual temperature in the desert varies from about 13 to 22 °C (55 to 72 °F), depending on elevation and latitude. The mean annual precipitation for the Chihuahuan Desert is 235 mm (9.3 in) with a range of approximately 150–400 mm (6–16 in), although it receives more precipitation than most other warm desert ecoregions. Nearly two-thirds of the arid zone stations have annual totals between 225 and 275 mm (8.9 and 10.8 in). Snowfall is scant except at the higher elevation edges. Northern and eastern portions have more definite winters than southern and western portions, receiving a portion of winter precipitation as snowfall most winters. The creosote bush ( ) is the dominant plant species on gravelly and occasional sandy soils in valley areas within the Chihuahuan Desert. The other species found with creosote bush depend on factors including the soil type, elevation, and degree of slope. Viscid acacia ( ), and tarbush ( ) dominate northern portions, while broom dalea ( ) occurs on sandy soils in western portions. and species are abundant on slopes and uplands in most areas, while Arizona rainbow cactus ( ) and Mexican fire-barrel cactus ( ) inhabit portions near the US–Mexico border. , such as bush muhly ( ), blue grama ( ), gypsum grama ( ), and hairy grama ( ), are dominant in desert grasslands and near the mountain edges including the Sierra Madre Occidental. Lechuguilla ( ), honey mesquite ( ), and are the dominant species in western . Ocotillo ( ), lechuguilla, and are the most common species in the southeastern part of the desert. Candelilla ( ), , and lechuguilla are found in areas with well-draining, shallow soils. The shrubs found near the Sierra Madre Oriental are exclusively lechuguilla, guapilla ( ), Queen Victoria's agave ( ), sotol ( spp.), and barreta ( ), while the well-developed includes grasses, , and cacti. Desert or arid grasslands comprise 20% of this desert and are often mosaics of shrubs and grasses. They include purple three-awn ( ), black grama ( ), and sideoats grama ( ). Early Spanish explorers reported encountering grasses that were belly high to a horse; most likely these were big alkali sacaton ( ) and tobosa ( ) along floodplain or bottomland areas. The United Nations Environment Programme reported in 2006 that nearly half of the bird, mammal, and butterfly species in the Chihuahuan Desert are expected to be replaced by other species by 2055 due to climate change.

        "html_text": " UNTAMED BEAUTY Places Arizona is the only state in the U.S. that contains four separate desert regions, each with their own environment, flora and fauna. Depending on who you ask, you’ll find three—arguably four—deserts in Arizona: the Chihuahuan in the southeast, the Mojave in the upper west, and the massive Sonoran taking up most of the southwest and central part of the state. The fourth, the Great Basin Desert, either extends south into the Navajo Nation—comprised of the Colorado Plateau—or stops along the Nevada-Utah border. Still others consider that area an entirely separate desert, the Navajoan. What’s certain is that, though they share the name, these deserts are home to vastly different environments. The Sonoran Desert Is it dry? Yes. Is it green? Also yes. And during wildflower season from March to mid-April, the Sonoran Desert turns shades of yellow, purple, red, white and pink. It’s also here that you’ll find that most iconic of Arizona symbols—the saguaro cactus. The Sonoran Desert also surrounds Arizona’s two largest cities, and , making it possible to hike remote desert trails in the morning, explore downtown in the afternoon and relax by a pool in the evening. Multiple sit within the desert, as well, with their own trails and camping options. The Mojave Desert The driest desert in North America, the Mojave crosses the Colorado River from California into northwestern Arizona and sits between the towns of Wickenburg and Kingman. Should you decide to drive from Kingman to Peach Springs and , you’ll inevitably pass through it. How will you know? Keep an eye out for the forest of Joshua trees that dot the landscape along the road. The Joshua trees are unique to this Arizona desert and are a favorite photo op for road-trippers. The Chihuahuan Desert Resembling the grasslands of Oklahoma more than the cactus-filled images of a stereotypical desert, the Chihuahuan Desert takes up much of southeastern Arizona, including the cities and towns of , , and . And sitting almost right in the middle are the Chiricahua Mountains, whose sea of pillar-shaped rock formations known as “hoodoos” stretch impossibly high into the sky.

        "html_text": "Non-profit group sees apparent surge in number of migrant deaths this year “Crossing the border may be illegal, but it should not be a death sentence,” reads a Facebook post from the non-profit group Humane Borders. But for 43 immigrants whose remains were found along Arizona’s borderlands with Mexico, the journey proved to be fatal. Scorched days in the Sonoran desert, with little to no water, and cold nights prove to be unforgiving to the weary travelers, many of whom flee violence, the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and economic despair in Central America and other regions. Humane Borders reported the remains were found on the border in June, which was the hottest one on record in Phoenix, with temperatures regularly above 110F (43C). The organization maps the recovery of bodies in Arizona using data from a medical examiner’s office in Tucson. The leading cause of death is exposure. Not all 43 of those people died in June, but at least 16 had been dead for just a day and another 13 for less than a week when they were found, said Mike Kreyche, the organization’s mapping coordinator, to the Associated Press. He noted the group’s figures include all bodies recovered of people believed to have been migrants and are higher than the number of deaths reported by the border patrol, which only counts those it handles in the course of its work. Kreyche said the 127 sets of remains found during the first half of this year were far higher than the 96 bodies recovered during the same period last year. This year’s six-month recovery toll is also higher than that of all of 2017, when 123 sets of remains were found near Arizona’s southern border. Humane Borders, and other humanitarian organizations like Tucson Samaritans and No More Deaths leave water jugs and supplies in remote parts of the desert in hopes of saving dehydrated migrants. More than 3,700 migrant deaths have been documented in the region since 2004. The US border patrol’s Yuma Sector emphasized the risk of crossing through the desert to reporters this month. “The desert is vast and treacherous. When you cross illegally, you put yourself in incredible peril,” said sector chief patrol agent Chris T Clem. “And our hot season is just beginning.” Migrant deaths are increasing in other border states and counties, including at Brooks county sheriff’s department in south Texas, which reported 36 deaths in the first five months of 2021, more than all of last year. The area there is known as the “desert of the dead”, according to local news stations. The remains of more than 800 immigrants have been located in Brooks county in the past decade. On California’s border with Mexico, border patrol agents have reported many rescues in the desert. According to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), El Centro sector border patrol agents have rescued 231 individuals since October 2020. Several were taken into custody after being transported to area hospitals. In accordance with Title 42, a Trump-era Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rule, many are deported. “Smuggling organizations are abandoning migrants in remote and dangerous areas, leading to a dramatic rise in the number of rescues CBP performs,” said the agency. The Associated Press contributed to this report. "

It was a good park and we're glad we went. It would have been nice if it wasn't so far and if there were more organ pipe cacti. Driving in, we didn't see any until we got to the visitors center. We enjoyed our couple of days in Organ Pipe. We stayed out at the Visitor's Center. It was open with limited times of operation. We browsed through the little museum area there before starting our drive through part of the park. We took the 21-mile loop on the Ajo Mountain Drive and enjoyed beautiful scenic views. We stopped and did the short Arch Canyon hike for more beauty and a little exercise! The next day we drove the 2-way section of the Puerto Blanco Drive. Part of that loop drive is only one-way, with the last part closed due to construction. We didn't want to go the other way up to Ajo, so we returned the way we'd come in. Our final hike was north a short way and started at the Alamo Canyon campground. Beautiful views once again. There are more hiking opportunities that we will have to come back to take advantage of. Beautiful park. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is a U.S. National Monument and UNESCO biosphere reserve located in extreme southern Arizona that shares a border with the Mexican state of Sonora. We didn't want to stay long because we had a ways to travel so we followed the website's 'What to do if you have 2 hrs.' First, I looked up organ pipe cactus because I wasn't sure what they were. According to the internet, Pipe Organs are most common columnar northwestern mainland Mexico the northern most part of their range in southwest Arizona. Organ pipe cactus generally branch right at the ground and their columns are much narrower than that of the saguaro. It's easy to distinguish once you know. Unfortunately, I thought organ pipe was a common name for saguaro so took many pictures of those. The organ pipe cactus, is rarely found in the US. There are 31 species of cacti in the monument, ranging from the giant saguaro to the miniature pincushion. I really enjoyed this diversion from driving on the freeway. It is beautiful, educational and, almost, mystical seeing the cactus stretch across the desert. Check out the website before you get to the site. I spent much time photographing saguaro, cholla and other cactus. Waaay out of the way if you are driving to or from San Diego. But this is a beautiful place. You get all kinds of topography and fauna. Arches in cliffs, hikes into canyons. The crowds are thIn and that makes it even more special. At many parks or monuments the crowds are overwhelming. Here tho, the place stands out. Visitor center. We love us some cacti and wanted to see the organ pipes so we made the 2 Hour drive from Phoenix to this remote area of the state. Well there weren't as many as I expected to see, it was well worth the trip. This is not somewhere that there are many tourists, so the crowds are thin. This is welcome when visiting a national monument, as opposed to throngs of people many other places I have visited. It is delivered truck to get here, beautiful terrain, and something very slow, moving, and deliberate about this part of the desert. We spent some time at the visitor center, I walked the loop out back and also took the dogs for a little walk around the front. We did a little driving, but because we had the dogs, no hiking. Just a day trip, but enough to see what we needed to. Reading about the history of the park, the violence from a couple of decades ago and the visitor center being named after ranger Kris Eggle was moving. I don't know that I would come back, but I'm glad we came. It is someplace I would probably like to hike around and do a scenic drive if I had more time. There are wonderful surprises on the road of life that certainly delight. A fiver in the pocket of last season's coat, a new friend in an unexpected place, or an old VHS of from a long-forgotten family reunion. These kinds of surprises jump out at us, not to scare or startle, but to evoke uncontrollable smiles, great fits of laughter or a deep sense that the universe is a bit more caring than we'd like to let on.I suppose, then, that Organ Pipe Cactus NM is the road trip embodiment of this principle, and only a larger symbol of each of the simple and surprising delights found within. I'm ashamed to admit that I hadn't heard of the park before my recent road trip, but when weather threatened northern Arizona, we scrolled through the map and saw this chunk of green-legend land coded on the screen and a quick zoom revealed the name. Organ Pipe Cactus? That sounds cool!And that was it. Off we went, bounding west from Tucson over the lonely two-lane Highway 86. If ever there's a stretch of highway deserving of that cliché, it's the 86. It carves out a mean curve, dipping south the northwest again in deference to the bumpy mounted topography west of Coyote Mountain Wilderness Area. From there, it flattens in a long, straight line until a sharp curve to the north into Why, Arizona. A southbound turn onto Highway 85, a quick fillup and supply run at the convenience store, and we were into the park boundaries.The national monument is named for the Organ Pipe Cactus, which earns its name deservedly. Long, tubular cactus branches curve out of the ground and reach high into the sky with their prickly fingers. Some have wacky and wavy curves, but most do resemble the backdrop of a pipe organ, reaching up in somewhat different sizes. If it had been up to me, I would have called it Upside Down Octopus Family National Monument which clearly demonstrates why I've not (yet!) ever named a national monument.The highway will deliver you to Mexico eventually, only a few miles from the visitors center. Now's as good as time as any to let you know there will be Border Patrol stops, and for every 10 cars you pass, at least half, perhaps 80% are from the agency. As noted on many signs in the park, immigration and smuggling is an everyday occurrence due to border proximity.Do check out the visitor center. There are some kindly rangers at the ready to explain what the park is all about, and how to get the most of it. Shout out to Les Jolley, who could not have a more ironic name, as he was more cheerful than just about any ranger I've met. He pointed us to camping ideas, hiking resources, and his excitement was contagious. There are two campgrounds in the monument. First, the big boy near the visitor center (Twin Peaks) holds a metric ton of people, and you're packed in. We tried to go for the other option, Alamo Canyon, as its sites are more spread out, and further from civilization. Alas, all four spots were taken. Instead, we went for option three: dispersed camping. There are nine zones where it's allowed, and rules to be followed, including a 1/2 mile from roads stipulation. We had a magical desert sunset, camp fajitas with tortillas bigger than an Oldsmobile, and the most memorable night of rain and cliff hiking in the dark possible; it was the exact adventure we had wanted.We opted for the 21-milee Ajo Mountain scenic drive. That morning was foggy, so much so that we could barely see the arch from the parking area, and only caught a glimpse or two of it before it disappeared in the mist. We hiked to the end of the trail, scrambled up the well-marked (but steep) social trail, and found a mini arch. Were we close to the big one? Who knows, it was a thick, mysterious cloud we hiked through that didn't let up all morning. We complete the loop, still enchanted by the dewy air, and then returned briefly to the visitors center before heading out for lunch and on to the next leg of the road trip.This landscape is like no other in the world. The Organ Pipe Cactus plant is a goofy but stately senator for the National Park Service. We only scratched the surface of this lesser-known monument. But it was a complete delight. A total surprise not on our agenda two days before, but immovable from memory now for life. And each new surprise within--the picnic area, the rain, the arch, the birds, the kind couple we met at the trailhead, the ranger, the fog--these are all heart-happy moments that remind me how delightful a thing this life can really be. Organ Pipe Cacti is a rare form of cacti in America and basically, this park is the only area that has them. Mexico has a bunch but it's not safe near the border overall. Organ Pipe is a desolate, super hot and schizo region. The summer heat easily hits 115-120 and during winter it can dip pretty low so prepare cautiously because no one can find you. In the event someone can find you, it is a dangerous predicament because of bad stuff that happens near this inhospitable border region involving smuggling humans, drugs and money. Nothing good happens whenever the underworld's money is threatened.Regardless of the existential threats, the views, scenery and colors is breathtaking. You have a good vantage points of the exterior and at times the interior since the main road is 3-5 hour loop. The desert is beautiful if you can understand the killer heat. Turtles, critters, snakes, plants, large avians and so much more. I didn't snap too many pics of animals cause they were hiding. Maybe next time! You might see a roadrunner if your lucky **beep beep**!I don't recommend wearing sandals when walking around here. Highly advise high-top steel toes with some wool/thicker socks in the event a snake bites ya. This region is home to the deadly yet gorgeous diamondback rattlers. Rattlers don't typically bite higher than the adult ankle so when they hit your boots, hopefully the snake will retract and go into a defensive position for you to walk back. Snakes don't chase humans however scorpions and poisonous critters will. Scorpions will claw at your toes and the pincher can pierce socks but not leather and metallic toe'd boots. If you see a scorpion, your best option is to squash it, kick it or stomp real hard to scare it. If it's not scared, then these nocturnal predators will attack your toes relentlessly. Getting bit by one of these tricks is basically a death sentence in the wilderness.Access/Roads:The main hub called the Kris Eggle Center is located off of HWY 89. It's visible, you can't miss it. Besides if you hit Mexico then duuuh, you passed it. If you are coming from Mexico and hit the second ICE checkpoint, duuh you passed it. The park has a west and east side.The east side makes a quick loop around Diablo Mountain.The west side is the main attraction where the Organ Pipe Cactus is located. The western portion has two entrances, the North and South entrance which is near Mexico however you have to visit the North sector if you want to check out the loop (the 3-5 hour version). The North and South entrances are a two-way for about 50 miles and then they become a one way. The northern is the entrance to the one-way while the Southern is the exit. When traveling on the Southwest corner, the road is two way for a second for local traffic. The dirt road to the right leads to small towns/Native territories. Please drive with care as the desert heat can blind ya. The entire loop is gravel paved with debris everywhere. Parking:Free. Plenty space on the dirt in the park and the center has paved roads.Distance:Phoenix (north from Ajo) is appx 120 miles or two hour drive.Yuma, AZ (west from) is appx 160 miles or 2.5 hours.Tucson, AZ (east) is appx 135 - 170 miles or 3 hrs (depends on route).Mexico (South) less than an hour.Costs:FreeNearby Attractions:ICE facilities & checkpoints (forced).Ajo Historical Society/Museum (North)Sonora Desert (North)Yuma Territorial Museum (West)Saguaro National Park (East)Other Notes:ICE/DEA checkpoints. There is one to the south and one to the north from Ajo. The checkpoints only stop vehicles traveling northbound on HWY 85.Warning for all you Californians. ICE agent stated Californians who go through here are typically up to no good. And wished us safe travels. If you are a Cali native and travel through here, the agents will assume you are up to nefarious activities so be prepared to convince them that you are not to prevent further hassles and time wasting. If you are up to no good then I hope they put you in the slammer.I can't wait to come back~! I was in Phoenix for a weekend last month and did a day trip down to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument -- and it was one of the coolest National Parks Service sites I've ever been to.Start at the visitors' center. The ranger we spoke with was really friendly and helpful, and she gave us good information and recommendations about how to see the park. There are bathrooms there and a spot to stamp your National Parks passports.Since we were there in mid-July -- too hot to hike -- we did the Ajo Mountain Drive, a 21-mile loop that takes 2-3 hours to make your way through. The scenery is beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Be sure to grab a map in the visitors' center so that you know where you are on the route and can read the corresponding info as you pass the mile markers. We didn't see any other people on the route the entire time we were out there, and we didn't have cell phone service, so you're pretty isolated (so you'll definitely want the map!).A couple other things to keep in mind: It gets super hot, so make sure you have plenty of water with you. Also, the weather can change really quickly -- it can go from sunny to thunderstorming in a matter of minutes. Drive with caution as the path is a little hilly, and only some parts are paved. We got caught in some strong storms and ended up just sitting in our car for 15-20 minutes until they passed. The views were absolutely stunning! You expect the desert to be bare but the amount of vegetation here was so varied, and it was so green! Do the smaller loop if pressed for time.

Melt caramels + 1/4 cup evaporated milk in the microwave for 1 minute, adding 30 second increments as needed until caramels melt and mixture is combined. Take pan out of freezer. 1 1/2 cups salted peanuts and pour evenly over the top. Use clean hands to gently press peanuts into nougat. Pour caramel mixture over the top of the peanuts. Return pan to freezer. Melt 1 cup chocolate chips + 1/4 cup peanut butter in the microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. Stir until smooth, then spread on top of the caramel, until even. Return pan to freezer for about 20 minutes. Cut into squares while bars are still cold. (this makes cutting nice and even!) Bars need to be stored in the fridge, but will still maintain their shape even when left out for a couple hours. They do get soft though, which is why I prefer to store them in the fridge. — — — — — Use the absolute BEST chocolate you have access to! Especially for this recipe where there are only 3 ingredients, each one really counts. I used semi sweet chocolate chips for this recipe. I’ve also used Ghirardelli chocolate chips, but they’re harder to find. Really any type of peanut butter, even the more natural varieties will work just fine in this recipe. The easiest way to measure out peanut butter in a recipe is with a . You can measure the peanut butter and push it out so easily without trying to scrape it all out of a regular measuring cup! These measuring cups work so well for peanut butter, honey, shortening…I use mine all the time! I prefer to buy either OR the caramel pieces in a bag that are specifically for baking, because the outer wrapper comes off really easily. Those small square caramels in the clear plastic wrapper are such a pain to unwrap! You can find the baking caramels on end caps, on the baking aisle or often in the produce section by the apples. I prefer to melt chocolate chips in the microwave because it is so fast and easy. Place the chocolate chips in a microwave safe dish (I like to use a glass Pyrex measuring cup) and then microwave for about 45 seconds. Stir the chocolate chips around and then return to the microwave for about 30 seconds. Stir again. Even if the chocolate chips aren’t completely melted, just keep stirring and see if they will melt all the way. If they still aren’t melted, microwave for another 15 seconds and stir again. You just want to be careful not to microwave the chocolate chips too long because then the chocolate will seize and be unusable. You can also melt the chocolate chips over the stove in a saucepan. Just turn the heat to low and stir the chocolate chips just until melted. Homemade Snickers Bars recipe makes you love your favorite candy bar even more. These chocolate peanut butter bars are surprisingly easy to make and melt in your mouth tasty! I began Butter, with a Side of Bread to delve deeper into my fascination with food! I love cooking easy, delicious recipes and trying out new products. Welcome and I hope you stick around! Anna Throop says I made these several weeks ago for church and they were a HUGE hit! It was decided that they are definitely better than store bought. I used my 9×13 pan and it work great! Jan Ramsey says I make this regularly. The addition of the peanut butter to the chocolate and nougat are the secret to this bats success! Gourmet Snickers ✌🏽 Brenda says Made this for someone’s birthday treat. The directions were very helpful and easy to follow. They came out pretty darn good….. hoping they ship well. (Put freezies in with them). Did save a few for myself 😉😉 Will def keep this recipe and share says Do these freeze well, after the fact? Jessica says These freeze BEAUTIFULLY!! My mother in law keeps a batch in her freezer, all cut up into small squares, then just pulls them out when she needs a quick dessert! Jane says Hi, I was noticing that some of the pictures have very clean sides where the nougat is so smooth and has a really tidy cut, and then some it’s a little more rough looking. I’m sure they taste absolutely amazing, but just wondering what you think made the difference in the look. Was the one with the sharper/cleaner sides colder? I’d like to make these for a party and would love to have the cleaner-looking sides if possible 🙂 Thank you so much!!! Nicole says Cutting the bars while they are still cold, while using a large hot chef knife works great at getting fine straight edges. You can hold a knife over a hot stove burner, heat it with a lighter, or run it under hot water to warm it up, but the hot blade passes through the chocolate and nugget with ease. Aimee says I love the idea of making these and I have all of the ingredients ready to go. My only complaint is that candy making recipes should really go by temperature rather than time. I’m really only grumpy because I have a stupid induction burner and wish I had gas. The induction burner cycles through on and off cycles instead of offering steady even heat. Can us unfortunate souls working with induction please get a temperature? Donnette says Way too sweet and mushy. It has to stay frozen to keep shape. The cup of sugar in the nougat is unnecessary. I spent $20 on the ingredients and threw the whole gooey mess in the trash because even if it wasn’t a gooey disaster it was so over the top sweet no one in my house could eat it. Jessica says It sounds like something didn’t go quite right… Your email address will not be published.

With two layers of chocolate, creamy nougat, peanuts, and plenty of caramel, these Homemade Snickers Bars taste just like the real candy bar. Learn how to make homemade candy (quite possibly even better than store bought!) in just 40 minutes. Every December, my sister-in-law Erin has a Baking Day. Yes, it’s so iconic, I now capitalize it like an official holiday! She takes a day off work to bake cookies and create platter upon platter of homemade candies for Christmas. Cookies, candies, brownies, bars; you name it, and she does it all by herself. Wistfully envious and 2,500 miles away, I recently perfected Homemade Snickers Bars so I can embark on my on Baking Day any time of the year. (Don’t mind me as I add , , and to the line-up, too.) Don’t be intimidated by the multiple layers. This homemade candy bar recipe only takes 40 minutes and the rich chocolate-caramel, nut-spiked results are well worth the time and effort. Two layers of semi-sweet chocolate (which I prefer over the milk chocolate in “real” Snickers bars) sandwiches marshmallowy nougat, crunch peanuts, and luscious caramel. Store-bought marshmallow fluff and a bag of caramels make this chocolate dessert recipe surprisingly simple. Beyond that, you just have to melt chocolate and peanut butter together. In the microwave. Just like Erin, you’ve got this! At a Glance: Here is a quick snapshot of what ingredients are in this recipe. Please see for specific quantities. If you’re not allergic to tree nuts, too, consider making these with almond butter, cashew butter, or walnut butter. For a nut-free solution, try sunflower seed butter. Instead of dry-roasted nuts, trade in chopped or even broken pretzel pieces. While the latter peanut substitute will taste a lot different from a classic Snickers bar, it’s still delicious. Think of it as similar to a Take 5 bar! You bet. Assemble Homemade Snickers Bars in a 9- by 13-inch pan. The 11- by 7-incher is about two-thirds of the size, so opting for a 9- by 13-inch pan instead will result in larger, thinner bars (that are still 100% tasty). People go wild for these No-Bake Peanut Butter Bars! They only take 5 ingredients and 10 minutes (plus chilling time) to make, and they take just seconds to disappear.

And that's true, but if you've got a peanut allergy like me, then eating Snickers isn't that normal. And when I got to cook from the blog for the Swiepswoepswap I knew what I wanted to taste after all these years. These are the ingredients that are needed to prepare this Snicker bars recipe. A printable recipe with easy steps can be found on the bottom of this blog. Step 1: Prepare the nougat: Put 2 cups of sugar, water, corn syrup and honey in a pan. Heat this to a syrup with a temperature of 262 degrees Fahrenheit (128 degrees Celsius). Take it of the heat. In the meanwhile beat the egg white with ¼ cup of sugar until stiff. Pour, while mixing, the warm syrup with the egg whites. Also add the confectioners sugar. Keep mixing on low speed until your nougat is cooled down to room temperature. Take it out of the bowl and knead for a few times. Fill your mold with the nougat and let it stiff. Then take the nougat out of the form. Step 2: Prepare the caramel: Fill a pan with the milk and butter and warm on medium heat until it's hot. Turn off the heat. In a second pan heat the sugar until the temperature reaches 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius). Turn of the heat and add the hot butter cream mixture. Put back on the heat and whisk until you've got a smooth creamy caramel. Turn of the heat. Pour the caramel into the mold (about ¼ inch thick) and spread the nuts into the caramel. Top that with the nougat and let it stiffen for 2 hours. Step 3: Take the nougat caramel bars out of the mold and put them on a rack. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate au-bain-marie (see top tips for the how-to). Brush the bottom with the melted chocolate. Step 4: Pour the melted chocolate on top of the candy bars .

Line a (or quarter baking sheet like I used) with . Make space in your freezer for the pan. You will be putting it in the freezer and pulling it back out several times. First you make the bottom chocolate layer, then the nougat layer, then the caramel layer, then the top chocolate layer. You can have several steps going on at once. I get my chocolate chips + peanut butter together in a bowl, ready to be melted and spread onto the bottom of the pan. I’ve also got my caramel bits + milk in a bowl, ready to be melted, as well as my butter + sugar + milk in a saucepan ready to be placed on the stove. Spray the 1/4 cup measuring cup with cooking spray so that your peanut butter comes out easily each time. Melt 1 cup chocolate chips + 1/4 cup peanut butter in the microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. Stir until smooth, then on the bottom of the pan. Put pan in freezer. Put butter, sugar and 1/4 cup evaporated milk in a small . Begin heating on medium heat, stirring occasionally as the butter melts and the mixture combines. Measure out 1/4 cup peanut butter and set aside. Continue heating mixture. When it comes to a boil, set timer for 6 minutes. After 6 minutes, remove from heat and stir in 1/4 cup peanut butter, the marshmallow cream and the vanilla. Stir until smooth. This is where it starts to even smell like a Snickers Bar! Take pan out of freezer and pour nougat on top of chilled chocolate. Smooth over chocolate until layer is even. Return to freezer. Melt caramels + 1/4 cup evaporated milk in the microwave for 1 minute, adding 30 second increments as needed until caramels melt and mixture is combined. Take pan out of freezer. 1 1/2 cups salted peanuts and pour evenly over the top. Use clean hands to gently press peanuts into nougat. Pour caramel mixture over the top of the peanuts. Return pan to freezer. Melt 1 cup chocolate chips + 1/4 cup peanut butter in the microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. Stir until smooth, then spread on top of the caramel, until even. Return pan to freezer for about 20 minutes. Cut into squares while bars are still cold. (this makes cutting nice and even!) Bars need to be stored in the fridge, but will still maintain their shape even when left out for a couple hours. They do get soft though, which is why I prefer to store them in the fridge. — — — — — Use the absolute BEST chocolate you have access to! Especially for this recipe where there are only 3 ingredients, each one really counts. I used semi sweet chocolate chips for this recipe. I’ve also used Ghirardelli chocolate chips, but they’re harder to find. Really any type of peanut butter, even the more natural varieties will work just fine in this recipe. The easiest way to measure out peanut butter in a recipe is with a . You can measure the peanut butter and push it out so easily without trying to scrape it all out of a regular measuring cup! These measuring cups work so well for peanut butter, honey, shortening…I use mine all the time! I prefer to buy either OR the caramel pieces in a bag that are specifically for baking, because the outer wrapper comes off really easily. Those small square caramels in the clear plastic wrapper are such a pain to unwrap! You can find the baking caramels on end caps, on the baking aisle or often in the produce section by the apples. I prefer to melt chocolate chips in the microwave because it is so fast and easy. Place the chocolate chips in a microwave safe dish (I like to use a glass Pyrex measuring cup) and then microwave for about 45 seconds. Stir the chocolate chips around and then return to the microwave for about 30 seconds. Stir again. Even if the chocolate chips aren’t completely melted, just keep stirring and see if they will melt all the way. If they still aren’t melted, microwave for another 15 seconds and stir again. You just want to be careful not to microwave the chocolate chips too long because then the chocolate will seize and be unusable. You can also melt the chocolate chips over the stove in a saucepan. Just turn the heat to low and stir the chocolate chips just until melted. Homemade Snickers Bars recipe makes you love your favorite candy bar even more.

Jane says Hi, I was noticing that some of the pictures have very clean sides where the nougat is so smooth and has a really tidy cut, and then some it’s a little more rough looking. I’m sure they taste absolutely amazing, but just wondering what you think made the difference in the look. Was the one with the sharper/cleaner sides colder? I’d like to make these for a party and would love to have the cleaner-looking sides if possible 🙂 Thank you so much!!! Nicole says Cutting the bars while they are still cold, while using a large hot chef knife works great at getting fine straight edges. You can hold a knife over a hot stove burner, heat it with a lighter, or run it under hot water to warm it up, but the hot blade passes through the chocolate and nugget with ease. Aimee says I love the idea of making these and I have all of the ingredients ready to go. My only complaint is that candy making recipes should really go by temperature rather than time. I’m really only grumpy because I have a stupid induction burner and wish I had gas. The induction burner cycles through on and off cycles instead of offering steady even heat. Can us unfortunate souls working with induction please get a temperature? Donnette says Way too sweet and mushy. It has to stay frozen to keep shape. The cup of sugar in the nougat is unnecessary. I spent $20 on the ingredients and threw the whole gooey mess in the trash because even if it wasn’t a gooey disaster it was so over the top sweet no one in my house could eat it. Jessica says It sounds like something didn’t go quite right… Your email address will not be published.

        "html_text": "NPS Photo Our Namesake Cactus The Organ Pipe Cactus (Stenocereus thurberi) Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is the only place in the United States to see large stands of organ pipe cacti, though their range extends far south into Mexico. The monument encompasses the bulk of its U.S. population. The organ pipe cactus is a wonderful example of the adaptations that cacti need to flourish in the Sonoran Desert. Like its fellow cacti and other desert inhabitants, the organ pipe is tuned to the rhythms of the sun and the infrequent rains. Most organ pipe cactus will grow without a “nurse tree” in totally unprotected areas. It is a warmth loving species that can be found on south facing rocky slopes in the monument. This location is critical during the winter months, when severe frosts can actually kill the entire cactus. Sub-freezing temperatures will kill young tissue at the end of the stems. When growth begins again, the results are indentations, or the appearance of circular waves on the organ pipes. Bumpy or wavy pipes are a record of previous battles with unusual cold. As a result, the range of the organ pipe cactus is limited by frost and freezing temperatures. In the summer it protects itself from heat and water loss by storing large quantities of water in its pulpy flesh, using a unique photosynthesis pathway, having a water proof skin, and shading itself with its sharp spines. NPS Photo Organ pipe cactus originated in the warm, dry tropics. When the global climate warmed at the end of the last Ice Age, the cactus slowly began migrating further north. It arrived in the Sonoran Desert only about 3500 years ago. Organ Pipe Cactus can live to over 150 years in age, and will only produce their first flower near the age of 35. Organ pipe cactus will bloom in May and June, opening its white, creamy flowers only at night. Flowers will close up again by mid-morning, and very rarely remain open into the afternoon. This leaves very little time for daytime pollinators to feast on the sweet flower nectar. Lesser long nosed bats do most of the night pollination, and over the centuries, have developed a unique relationship with these cactus. NPS Photo The fruit of the organ pipe ripens just before the summer rains and splits open to reveal a bright red seed-studded pulp. These seeds, with the aid of nurse plants or rocks, have the potential to grow from small seedlings into hundred-armed giants reaching ten to twenty feet into the air. Organ pipe cactus thrive in the Sonoran summer. High temperatures and the monsoon rains of July and August trigger the greatest cactus growth. Within the monument boundaries, an average organ pipe cactus stem grows about 2.5 inches a year. The monument offers the best growing locations for these columnar cactus in the United States. Optimum growing conditions exist no more than a 40-50 mile radius north of the monument. Beyond this distance, conditions are not suitable. The cactus will seldom occur naturally in these areas except in very isolated locations.

In 1976 the monument was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, and in 1977 95% of Organ Pipe Cactus was declared a . Land for the Monument was donated by the Arizona state legislature to the federal government during Prohibition knowing that the north–south road would be improved and make contraband alcohol easier to import from Mexico. In 1937 the land was officially opened as a national monument. At the north entrance of the park is the unincorporated community of ; the town of at the park's southern border is a border crossing point to , Sonora, Mexico.

On August 9, 2002, he was shot and killed by a during a operation. With a continuing, steady flow of immigrants and drug runners from Mexico, the majority of the park was closed in 2003. After being considered the most dangerous national park, the park reopened the backcountry after surveillance towers, vehicle barriers, and pedestrian fences were installed along the border. The first 30-foot (9.1 m) panels of a new Arizona, US-Mexico border wall were installed in August 2019 on a two-mile (3.2 km) stretch of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. It is the first of three projects that will add bollard walls along Southern Arizona's wildlife refuges.

Customs and Border Protection officials maintained that no human remains or artifacts were discovered in the areas where explosives were used, and that Monument Hill was previously disturbed in 2010 when the existing border fence was installed.

        "html_text": "Our mission is to serve the 50+ traveler who's ready to cross a few items off their bucket list. For a chance to walk amidst the spectacular organ pipe cacti that rise from the desert floor to form giant prickly bouquets of green stems, there is just one place to go in the United States: Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. The southern-Arizona national monument is known for its wealth of the distinctive cactus species that is whimsically named after a pipe organ. The region also stands out for its warm and sunny winter weather that allows for stellar hiking, biking, and camping from about November through March. Although organ pipe cacti are common in neighboring Mexico, stands of the species stretch north only as far as the land along the Sonora-Arizona border. That makes the only place in the United States where its namesake cacti are found in abundance. In fact, the park’s unique habitat has earned it an international designation as a . At about two hours from either Phoenix or Tucson, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument makes for a great Arizona road trip. The park is located along Highway 85 about 20 miles north of the Lukeville/Sonoyta border crossing. The Organ Pipe website notes that the national monument is a safe place to visit, with . It is important to remember, however, that Organ Pipe has experienced violence in the past — most notably in 2002 when was killed while pursuing members of a drug cartel who had fled into the United States after committing a string of murders in Mexico. Today, signs are posted along scenic roads and trails, warning visitors of the possibility of drug and human trafficking. When I visited in November, the park appeared quiet and safe, and I encountered no trouble whatsoever. Still, as in any remote outdoor location, it pays to be vigilant. Here are eight fantastic experiences at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. There’s nothing like a walk in the Sonoran Desert to remind you of the grandeur of nature, even in the harshest of conditions. Organ Pipe has a variety of that will get you right into the middle of it all. From the easy Nature Trail and Desert View Trail located near the monument’s visitor center to the numerous moderate trails in the Puerto Blanco Mountain area, the park offers plenty of variety. Pro Tip: Although a desert walk is not recommended in the extreme heat of summer, temperatures are optimal from November through April for a jaunt amidst the organ pipe giants. Scenic roads don’t get much more remote or spectacular than the , located just across Highway 85 from the monument’s visitor center. While the 21-mile route is the most popular scenic drive in the monument, it was mostly free of other vehicles when I drove it on a November Saturday, adding to the feeling of being in the middle of nowhere. Numerous pull-outs are available for stopping and taking in the distant mountain peaks and a wide variety of cactus life. Organ pipe cacti are the obvious stars, but there are plenty of saguaros, chollas, and ocotillos dotting the landscape as well. If you don’t feel comfortable driving the route yourself, you could take a three-hour ranger-guided tour from January to March, for a small fee. The scenic road is mostly gravel and is usually passable by passenger cars, although RVs over 24 feet are prohibited. At a certain point, the road transitions into a one-way loop section, after which drivers are not able to turn around and return the way they came. Pro Tip: Because of the proximity to the Mexican border, there was a spot along the drive where I was surprised to receive a cell phone text message from my service provider, Verizon, welcoming me to Mexico. When I inquired later at the visitor center, I was told that, no, the road does not cross the border, but yes, service often gets confused by a nearby Mexican satellite tower. I did not need to use my phone along the way, so it was not a problem for me. But the visitor center attendant said some drivers have encountered issues in dealing with Spanish-speaking operators when trying to make a call from the road. For a true adventure, visitors could choose to the scenic roads of the national monument rather than drive. The monument’s website notes that all of the scenic roads that are open to vehicular traffic are also open to bike traffic, although none of the hiking trails are. While the Ajo Mountain Road is popular among cyclists, the park advises cyclists to ride defensively since drivers are often focusing on the beautiful scenery and might not expect a bicyclist. The most iconic of the hikes in Organ Pipe National Monument is the through Arch Canyon. The trailhead is located at about the halfway point along the Ajo Mountain Road. Even before you arrive at the trailhead, you’re sure to spot the two arches, one on top of the other, high in the mountain range and backed by the blue Arizona sky. An easy, 1.2-mile roundtrip hike will get you to the end of the maintained trail, where an unofficial social path heads upward behind the arches. The hike to that point offers plenty of opportunity for viewing the arches from below, and the monument’s website stresses that the primitive social trails are strenuous and unmaintained, with precarious footing. The first stop you should make upon arriving is the Kris Eggle Visitor Center, where you’ll find history about the fallen park ranger who the center is named after, as well as exhibits about the ecology, culture, and history of the area. After browsing the exhibits, head to the small movie theater for an informative film on the people who have lived in the area over the past 1,600 years ago or so, their ancestors leaving behind projectile points, seashells, pottery, and rock art. The center also includes a small shop that stocks books, maps, and souvenirs. For a chance to sleep in the desert beneath a dark sky illuminated by countless stars or the glow of a full moon, consider in one of the 34 tent sites or 174 RV sites at the Twin Peaks Campground. Four primitive sites are also available at the Alamo Campground, a desert site located in the Alamo Canyon. During the off-season (April through December), Twin Peaks sites are first-come-first-served, with self-registration. In the peak season (January through March), advance registration is required by visiting . Pro Tip: With average high daytime temperatures in the 70-degree range from November through March and nighttime lows in the 40s, winter camping is popular at Organ Pipe. Just 15 minutes or so north of Organ Pipe National Monument is the charming little town of , a historic copper mining community with a beautiful Spanish Colonial Revival-style town center flanked by towering palm trees. Anchored by a historic train depot, the town center is a lovely spot to take an evening stroll as the sun sets. Afterward, consider stopping by for a dinner of authentic Mexican cuisine. Wander a few blocks off the town center area, and you will pass by the colorful murals that adorn the walls of many Ajo businesses. Be sure to take a walk down Artists Alley, where Southwest-inspired art lines both sides of the lane. For a wonderful alternative to camping at Organ Pipe, check out the , a 1940s-era elementary school campus that has been transformed into a unique inn with a fascinating “Southwest Industrial” design. As you make your way between Ajo and Organ Pipe, you will come across the tiny unincorporated community of Why. The name, which has appeared on many lists of unusual town monikers, is said to have originated as the spot where two highways — 85 and 86 — formed a Y intersection. Today, Why is mostly a stopping-off spot for people in need of gasoline or supplies as they head toward Organ Pipe or the Mexican beach town of Puerto Penasco (Rocky Point). The has a range of deli offerings, snacks, and fast-food items. It is also a good place to stretch your legs and take a restroom break before continuing on down the road. But mostly, a stop in Why is about that quirky name. Pro Tip: Although Organ Pipe National Monument can seem remote, it is actually located along the route that many Arizonans drive to get to Puerto Penasco, a beautiful Sonora, Mexico, town on the Sea of Cortez. During busy beach times, expect to encounter plenty of traffic on Highway 85, as well as several immigration checkpoints.

Geology lovers and avid Instagrammers alike will be drawn to the otherworldly hues of the Rainbow Mountains.

Cappadoccia is our number one pick out of all the beautiful places in the world that we visited. Be sure to stay in a cave hotel when you do go to Cappadocia, it’s heavenly. Santorini truly lives up to its reputation as a beautiful destination. It’s one of the most romantic places we’ve ever been and our favorite Staying in a luxury cave hotel in Oia was a dream come true. Santorini is definitely the star of the and for good reason.

Secluded private islands house luxury hotels with over the water bungalow. The sand is soft and white as snow creating the perfect island paradise escape. Whenever people ask us what our favorite destination is, Dave always answers Antarctica. The reason? Because it is one of the most beautiful places to photograph on earth. The different shades of blue ice and snow layer the landscape. Massive ice. formations the size of buildings drift through the deep blue water and the skies are crisp and clear. There is no place in the world quite like Antarctica. While Dave loves Antarctica, I (Deb) love Tanzania. And no place is as beautiful as the Serengeti. The wildlife is outstanding, but the sunsets and landscape of great plains of Africa are second to none. Every beautiful picture that you see of those African sunsets really are that gorgeous! It has been well over a decade since we visited Sapa in Vietnam, but it’s striking scene will always be etched in our minds. While hiking through the plunging rice terraces in high mountains on the border of China, I felt as if each turn was a picture in a National Geographic photo story.

It wasn’t until we traveled to Bavaria in Germany last summer that we finally saw it with our own eyes, and it did not disappoint.

While driving through Mongolia during the Mongol Rally, I couldn’t get over the vastness of the landscape. I know that sounds strange to say, but the Mongolian Steppe is so wide open, that even the skies feel bigger here than anywhere else in the world. The Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador are one of the most unique ecosystems in the world. Here you’ll find wildlife unlike anywhere else on earth due to their isolation. The diverse landscape ranges from lush forests to isolated beaches and arid deserts. We fell in love with the beauty of this unique little corner of the world. While driving the Dempster Highway of Yukon Canada, we commented on how much it looked like Mongolia. Not a lot of people visit the Yukon, but if you do, you will agree that it is one of the most beautiful, lush and diverse. landscapes on earth. Drive from Inuvik in the Northwest Territories to Dawson City for a and adventure! I couldn’t believe my eyes when I first saw the Giant’s Causeway. There are other basalt formations around the world, but none seem as symmetrical as here. The stone steps are so perfect, that it is almost possible to believe the legend that the Giant, Fionn McCool laid these stones to create a link to . They look exactly like patio stones that a giant would lay. While walking along the 2km long Siq to Petra we had no idea what to expect. The narrow gorge path was filled with beautiful scenes, ruins and formations but it was when we turned the corner to view the Petra Treasury that I let out a gasp. It was so beautiful. We had been to many ancient cities by this time and didn’t think we could be surprised by beauty anymore, but Petra caught us off guard. Petra excited us and made us remember how travel can still surprise and delight. Living close to , we always compare waterfalls around the world to the one in our own backyard. But there is no comparison between the two. Iguazu Falls is in the middle of a jungle. It is wild and untamed and is an impressive set of 275 waterfalls plunging into a canyon that is 2.7 km long! Standing on the boardwalk engulfed by the waterfalls and jungle was one of the most incredible scenes we had ever seen! South Africa has many beautiful places to visit, but there is something special about the beauty of Cape Town. This city is framed by the towering Table Mountain creating the most unique cityscape we’ve ever laid eyes upon. It almost looks like someone has dropped a giant background behind the picturesque waterfront. With beaches, colourful colonial architecture, and a gorgeous seaside, this city has it all and it is gorgeous. The Pyramids of Giza can be seen from all over Cairo. They look like a mirage jutting up from the desert. When I first saw them while driving from the airport to our hotel, I didn’t think I was actually seeing the pyramids. That couldn’t be them, could it? It was! The pyramids have never lost their mystique and allure and seeing them with our own eyes was a dream come true. You can’t take photography tours to Antelope Canyon anymore, but you can still see them. The draw of this canyon is to witness the short window where the sun shines through an opening once per day to create a waterfall of light illuminating the layered rocks in this impressive cavern. It is truly a wonder of the world. Check out We have seen a lot of mountains in our time and they are all beautiful, but there is something extraordinary about the world’s highest mountain range. While trekking to Everest Base Camp, we actually commented that you almost feel that you could reach out and touch the heavens. Nothing compares to the beauty of the Himalayas. We had always wondered if the Himalayas were as beautiful as we remembered and then when visiting Bhutan, we were reminded just how striking they are. We trekked deep into the mountains for views just as impressive as Everest, but even short climbs like this one to Tiger’s Nest Monastery was absolutely beautiful. Many people think that Greenland is just one big slab of ice. But Greenland is filled with color and beauty. Nowhere did we see that more than when hiking out to the world’s most active calving glacier in Ilulissat. The rainbow-colored houses of Illulisat make way for the deep green hues of the Arctic Tundra leading towards Margerie Glacier where beautiful and massive icebergs crash in the sea. There is nothing like seeing the power of mother nature up close and personal. Ha Long Bay is stunning. A cruise through the endless scene of limestone islands surrounded by turquoise and emerald green waters is a must when visiting Vietnam. It was while hiking from the Cat Ba Cave to a high lookout that we were totally taken aback. When we looked down to see the scene of junk boats surrounded by karts, we knew, we were in someplace special. Australia has some incredible places to visit, but I think its most beautiful destination is the Twelve Apostles on the Great Ocean Road. We hiked for four days along the dazzling coast before reaching the giant sentries standing guard in the sea. Take a helicopter tour to really take in its beauty. Climbing to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro was one of our greatest adventures and seeing Furtwangler Glacier with our own eyes was unbelievable. We didn’t notice its beauty until we started our descent, because all the way up, we were looking down at our feet! As I watched Dave cross its path, I felt tears well in my eyes because of the immense beauty before me. As the sun rose, the ice turned to a glowing shade of pink that we will never forget. It’s too bad I didn’t have my camera raised to take a photograph, but I did capture it on video. New Zealand is one of our favourite destinations on earth and the South Island has one of the most diverse landscapes in the world! You can see a lot in a short time. Milford Sound in Fjordland National Park has some of the highest sea cliffs on earth rising 1,200 meters above the water. A cruise of Milford Sound is one of the top things to do in New Zealand. Sheer rock faces rise up from the blue waters blending into the perfect blues skies dotted with fluffy clouds. I know I have already included a great waterfall of the world by mentioning Iguazu, but Victoria Falls needs to be on this list as well. It is the world’s largest waterfall plunging down in one continuous curtain for 1.7 km. Seeing from a helicopter is a must. From above is the best way to really see its scope. The Masai Mara may be Kenya’s top draw, but it was Lake Nakuru that we really fell in love with the beauty of Kenya. Known for the flamingos and pelicans that frequent its alkaline shores, Lake Nakuru is a picturesque location in Africa. It’s also one of the best places to see rhinos in Africa. Iceland is known for its waterfalls and none are quite as famous as Seljalandsfoss. It is has been featured in so many movies including the recent Netflix comedy, Eurovision. Be sure to go behind the falls for this view. We had never even heard of Voidokilia Beach before visiting Costa Navarino, but when we saw this perfect horseshoe beach, we couldn’t believe that such a beach existed. You can bicycle or hike up to a high lookout to see the stunning beach that looks exactly like the Greek letter Omega. Ireland is one of our favorite destinations on earth. It also has some of the most beautiful scenery on earth. It was difficult to choose what was the best and most beautiful of Ireland, so we thought we’d go with the most famous, The Cliffs of Moher. If you go at sunrise or sunset, you’ll avoid the crowds and experience amazing skies! Our cruise took us through one beautiful scene after another. Just when we thought the cliffs couldn’t get higher we’d turn a corner and there’d be another massive mound before our eyes. The reflections in the waters made for incredible views. Rio is an exciting city to visit, but when going up to the top of , or taking a you really witness just how striking the coast is. The beaches are some of the best in the world with famous names like Ipanema and Copa Cabana. The endless white sand is framed by the giant Sugarloaf and Two Brother’s mountains making for an epic scene. I think Rio is the most beautiful city on earth, especially when you take its ocean and mountainous setting into consideration. I’m not going to lie. When visiting the Grand Canyon, I wasn’t expecting much. I thought it would be a cheesy tourist trap, but it lives up to the hype! There is a reason the is featured in so , it is spectacular. and Arizona brought us to this place, and I am so glad that we saw it with our own eyes. Read: Most people think of the Middle East when picturing deserts, but our first real desert experience was in Peru, and it blew our minds. We didn’t know that sand dunes could be so high! Staying in the desert oasis and climbing up to the top of the sand dunes was amazing. We were overwhelmed with the endless shadows rolling before our eyes. Who knew that South Dakota has so much to offer. We were invited on an Instagram trip to the state a few years ago thinking we’d have trouble finding interesting photos to capture. It turned out that South Dakota is photogenic at nearly every turn. There’s more to it than The Badlands are truly spectacular Most people will say the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest in Japan is one of the most beautiful places in the world. But we haven’t been there. However, we have been to many other bamboo forests throughout Southeast Asia. None of them compare to Maui’s Bamboo Forest. Located along the Pipiwai Trail along the Hana Highway there are other beautiful things to see including high cascading waterfalls. But the bamboo forest is really an incredible site. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the natural wonders of the world. It is popular for diving and snorkelling, but seeing from above was the most beautiful way to experience it. The green coral reef dotted the waters of the coral sea. With hundreds of islands and atolls stretching over 344,400 square kilometers (133,000 square miles) it is one of the great places to fly over in the world. Driving the North Coast of 500 showcased so many beautiful places in Scotland.But it was when taking a detour to the Isle of Skye that we managed to view one of the most beautiful places in the world. Its fairy pools have long attracted visitors, and we were excited to see the Old Man of Storr. There are so many beautiful places to visit in Iceland it is difficult to choose. I mean, the waterfalls are endless, the hot springs are so inviting and the lava fields and volcanic coast are picture-perfect. How do you choose? It’s not easy but Reynisfjara Beach on the coast of Vik is so often featured in movies and tv series it must be special. The black sand beach, the basalt columns, and the enormous sea stacks are out of this world. It’s often stormy and moody creating an ominously beautiful scene. Greece deserves its own “beautiful places to visit” list, but for now, I must include this awe-inspiring view. The Monasteries of Meteora date back to the 9th century but the monoliths were formed over thousands of years. Located in central Greece, these isolated monasteries sit atop giant pillars jutting out of the lush valley. This is so beautiful it was used as the setting for the city in the clouds in Canada has many picturesque fishing villages, but nothing quite compares to This UNESCO World Heritage Site is so strict that residents and businesses cannot change the colours or designs of their houses.It’s a good thing too, because this is the most beautiful town in Canada. (in my opinion). Alaska is North America’s final frontier and there are striking scenes at every turn. But it is Mount McKinley in Denali National Park that takes the cake. Seeing it from the ground is impressive, but flying up to see it from bird’s eye view is out of this world. After we hopped a flight to the paradise island of Zanzibar. It was after leaving Stone Town for the beaches of Nungwi that we fell in love with the beauty of this island. When the tide goes out to reveal layers of colour on the ocean floor it reveals the deepest shades of green. When the tide is in, the turquoise water is just as beautiful as it crashes against the pure white sand. The Li River in Yangshuo China is one of the most picturesque scenes we’ve ever witnessed. Taking a bamboo raft down the Li River really allowed us to take in the beauty of the surrounding karst formations that make this enchanting part of China so famous. Most people suggest the Namib Desert and sand dunes of Sossusvlei. But while cycling through Namibia, we had our heads down until reaching Fish River Canyon. With a night off to relax and take in the view, I’ll never forget overlooking the endless ravine spanning 100 miles before our eyes. Massive white formations dot the desert landscape. of Western Egypt, creating a surreal scene. We stayed overnight in a Bedouine camp surrounded by monoliths resembling mushrooms, camels, and hawks. We were surprised to see that when we touched the rock, it was actually made of chalk. As the sun went down the sky exploded in colours creating one of the most beautiful desert scenes we had ever witnessed. Read more: Oh, how we would love to go back and photograph the pinnacles.

This two day trek takes you to the middle of Gunung Mulu National Park in Malaysian Borneo to see the most beautiful display of pinnacles we’ve ever seen.

Giant pinnacles of sandstone rock tower over the Elbe River and the green countryside. Spanning these pinnacles is a stone bridge, dramatic in its appearance, as it connects these towers of rock and then seems to lead nowhere. The term Bastei refers to the jagged groups of sandstone rocks located in Saxon Switzerland National Park. Hundreds of years ago, the Neurathen Castle stood on these rocks. Now, not much of that castle remains. It’s the bridge, Basteibrücke (Bastion Bridge), that is the main attraction here. How to Visit the Bastei: The Bastei is located in Saxon Switzerland National Park, 40 km east of Dresden, Germany. You can visit this place on a day trip from Dresden or Berlin.

All the Photos of the places are simply brilliant. They can incite anyone to plan for a trip. I second all your thoughts. Recently I have been to Hallstatt. No doubt in its beauty. But I could not take the mad rush! Indeed, when a place is this beautiful, everyone wants to go. But what I found difficult was – The viewpoints were filled with camera tripods. Honestly, I had to manage to see the town between the legs of tripods. To top it, skirt-twirling pretty girls and jacket-wearing handsome guys took hours together, blocking almost every best viewpoint. Maybe I went at the wrong time! That pretty much sums up our visit too. I think an overnight stay would make it a better experience, to stroll the streets in the morning and evening when they are less crowded. Cheers, Julie Norway… I’d like to visit and see especially the fjords. And Portugal.. I’ve no idea about Algarve, but looks great. Thanks for this glimpse of Europe. I found several places I had not really considered traveling to, like Hallstatt! Adding to my list! You’re welcome. Have fun in Halstatt!

When the coon lifts his paw out of the hole with the shiny object, it gets stuck on some angled nails. Billy tries this, but for days he doesn’t catch a coon.

He will never leave a raccoon once he is on its trail, although sometimes his impatience gets the best of him, and he loses the trail. Little Ann is one of Billy's red bone coonhounds. She is smaller but smarter than Old Dan. She is a beautiful hound, and will not stop hunting until she knows exactly where the coon is hiding. No coon can trick her. For a hound, she is extremely playful. Billy's papa is a good, honest farmer. He is poor, but is working hard so his family can move to the city.

        "html_text": "“There between the graves, a beautiful red fern had sprung up from the rich mountain soil. It was fully two feet tall and its long red leaves had reached out in rainbow arches curved over the graves of my dogs. … I had heard the old legend about the red fern. How a little boy and girl were lost in a blizzard and had frozen to death. In the spring, when they were found, a beautiful red fern had grown up between their two bodies. The story went on to say that only an angel could plant the seeds of a red fern, and they never died; where one grew, that spot was sacred.” —Wilson Rawls, For a dog whose reason-to-be is the down-to-earth job of chasing critters through the woods, there is something mysterious, mystical even, about the . Author Wilson Rawls knew it when he penned his 1961 autobiographical novel. The modern Redbone started to take form sometime in the decades before the Civil War. That’s when hunters in Georgia, accustomed to gray foxes, found themselves facing a new adversary—the quicker, more wily red fox, noted Joel Chandler Harris in an 1893 edition of Scribner’s Magazine. It was confounding the hunting packs. “‘Old Spot,’ to characterize the long-eared ‘blobber-mouthed’ hound was nowhere. Old Spot and his breed could run down a gray fox in five or six hours, but the red ran right away from them, leaving a cold trail behind him,” Harris wrote. After a disastrous night when his dogs disappeared in pursuit of red fox, only to arrive home the next morning, exhausted and dispirited, Georgia plantation owner L.F.W. Birdsong resolved to develop a hound up to this opponent. He based his breeding on of Dr. Thomas Y. Henry, a grandson of Patrick Henry. The name may have come from a later breeder named Peter Redbone. Careful selection eventually produced a fleet, courageous hound, with superior skills at tracking and treeing game and a very cold nose, one that can pick up a trail that was days, even weeks, old. Redbone breeders focused on looks as well as hunting savvy, and cultivated a lean, muscular appearance and a striking crimson coat. Fanciers will tell you that a good Redbone should look as if he’s been carved from a block of mahogany. By the mid-20th century, the Redbone was favored among hunters who wanted a partner to be all business when it came to treeing the game, whether it was a raccoon or a cougar. They were also said to be the most uniform of the coonhound breeds, and, as they are viewed today, the most beautiful. “Redbones we have owned have sung to us in tones we can still hear. They were all among the top cooners we have owned,” wrote Leon F. Whitney, DVM, and Ancil B. Underwood in 1952 in The Coon Hunter’s Handbook. “One seldom finds a Redbone that potters. While many dogs of other types seem to enjoy the scent so much that they don’t care whether they ever get to the tree, the Redbones seem determined to get the coon.” At the dawn of organized coon hunting, after World War II, the breed dominated the competition. A Redbone named Dan, owned by Leroy Campbell from Mississippi, won the first AKC/ACHA World Championship in 1948. Redbones also were prized among those who hunted, not just for trophies, but to put food on the table. The Redbone Coonhound was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1902, the second coonhound breed to gain recognition. In 2010, the breed was It was the story of two such Redbones, Little Ann and Old Dan, that introduced the breed to the general public. Several of today’s dedicated fanciers picked this breed after reading or seeing the movies made from The book was an influence on Christine Smith and her husband Mike when they were looking to add a dog to their family. Smith, president and founder of the Redbone Coonhound Association of America, believes that the children’s classic offers the truest depiction of the breed she loves, especially the devotion of Little Ann and Old Dan. “That was one of the factors that got us, the relationship with the boy,” says Smith, who was primarily interested in a family companion for her two sons. At the same time, Smith wanted a dog for her husband, who enjoyed coon hunting. Today they share their life with seven Redbones, and all have proven to be excellent companions at home and on the hunt. They possess terrific noses and a never-say-die intensity about treeing. Smith also believes they are extremely accurate, less likely to be fooled by the raccoon’s tricks. “Redbones seem more certain,” she says. The qualities that make Redbones great on a raccoon’s trail are proving invaluable for one of the most vital modern canine jobs— . It’s an area traditionally dominated by Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherd Dogs, and Bloodhounds, but some handlers have started to try coonhounds, with excellent results. Joan Brehm, Ph.D., president of Illinois Search Dogs, a nonprofit volunteer organization in Bloomington, got her first K-9 partner in 1997. Chief, was a Redbone mix who worked in avalanche, land, and water cadaver searches. Redbone was dominant in his blood, and Brehm was consistently “amazed by the high sensitivity of his nose and his ability to locate the target odor in the smallest amounts and over extended periods of time and distance,” she says. “As I continued to work with Chief I knew that I wanted my next SAR dog to be a full Redbone Coonhound due to their amazing power of smell and also their tenacity. They do not give up hunting for the target odor until they find it, no matter what.” Her current partner, Sula, is everything Brehm hoped for— an exceptional nose, especially for cold trails, and boundless endurance. She has earned certification from the International Police Work Dog Association in advanced land cadaver detection, water cadaver detection, and trailing. “Her ability to be proficient and certified in multiple disciplines also shows how versatile the breed is—they can do more than just trailing, which is what most people think of when they hear coonhound.” Not that it’s all been a breeze. Some of Sula’s most valuable traits—tenacity and independence—presented significant training challenges. “With patience and persistence, I was able to use that independence in my favor and condition her to hunt for what I wanted her to hunt— people, not coons or other critters.” Once they got over that hurdle, Sula became a superb SAR dog. “I have been on numerous searches with Sula so far in her young life and she has never disappointed,” Brehm says. “For me, the Redbone breed has proven to be an outstanding choice, and one that I would make again in the future.” Any Redbone Coonhound owner will tell you, as Wilson Rawls wrote, that there is something sacred about the bond between Redbones and their people.

Billy's grandfather runs a general store and a small mill. His store is a place where coon hunters gather to talk about hunting. He is full of imagination, and gets Billy into a lot of adventures.

Then, the last death is another dog passing from grief. The ghost coon symbolizes a long-standing and permanent tie to the area, the Ozarks. That none of the other hunters could tree the coon was a symbol that they are destined to stay.

        "html_text": "The Redbone Coonhound, according to the American Kennel Club, is amiable, eager to please, and easy-going. However, for those who enjoy hunting with hounds, the Redbone Coonhound is a valuable partner on the hunting trail. He is highly adaptable to even the most difficult terrain, whether it be steep hills or the muddiest of scent trails. He possesses an amazing scenting talent, and, while requiring a great deal of exercise to remain happy, the Redbone Coonhound is actually one of the most easy-going of the scent hounds. Forever ingrained in the general public's memory as Old Dan and Little Ann of Where the Red Fern Grows, the Redbone Coonhound is both a great hunter and a great companion. Huckleberry's slow, Southern accent was meant to give the impression that the pup was a rube, or someone easily fooled. Certainly, Huckleberry finds himself in a wide variety of roles. He tries to play the part of a policeman to no avail. He also attempts a run as a dogcatcher. Although Huckleberry is unsuccessful in many of his endeavors, by the end of the cartoon short, the hound has usually managed to find himself on the winning end of the deal. Many times, Huckleberry's persistent patience assisted him in being successful in his work. Huckleberry Hound is also known for his off-key rendition of Oh My Darling, Clementine. Huckleberry Hound is known for being a jack of many trades. The pup has been portrayed as a Roman gladiator, a sheriff, and a rocket scientist. Huckleberry Hound's name can be directly attributed to Mark Twain's infamous character, Huckleberry Finn. Huckleberry Hound would also make appearances alongside Yogi Bear and Boo Boo in Yogi's Gang . Huckleberry Hound remained a popular character for many years both on his own program and on other Hanna-Barbera cartoons. As previously stated, the Redbone Coonhound was the type of dog featured in Wilson Rawls' classic Where the Red Fern Grows. In the book (and the film), Billy Colman works for two years to save $50 in order to purchase two Redbone Coonhounds. He names these two pups Old Dan and Little Ann. If a person enjoys the book, then naming one's Redbone Coonhounds after the two pups in the novel will be the perfect choice. Of course, the primary function of the Redbone Coonhound is to scent out prey and help to flush it out in the open for hunters. Although coonhunting is not a very popular sport anymore, this is the reason Billy Colman purchased his dogs. In this instance, the Redbone Coonhound will often find the coon perched in a tree, and the dog will bellow until his human partner joins him at the foot of said tree. This means that names dealing with hunting such as Scout or Ranger are fitting for the breed. In addition, Redbone Coonhound owners might also give their pup a traditional Southern name such as Susie, Otis, or Dixie. Regardless of what you decide to name your Redbone Coonhound, keep in mind his propensity for loyalty and friendliness. Names like Buddy encompass the personality of the relationship you are likely to have with your new Redbone Coonhound.

The perfect tool to get your weird on is none other than Google Earth. That’s right – the satellite images provided to us by the world’s most popular search engine is home to the creepiest (and funniest) images from an aerial perspective. I have to admit, I often find myself going down the rabbit hole that is “weird find on Google Earth” on YouTube, Reddit, etc. There’s something eerie about it but also fascinating. It’s almost as if we shouldn’t be looking at what we’re looking at but because of Google – we are! That’s not to say that there are things in Idaho or surrounding states that weren’t meant to be found. Take Idaho for example. Someone took the time to put together a message that’s only visible from above and it’s actually a message of kindness. On the other hand, you have oddities like the one found in a California desert. Seriously, this has to be one of the most bizarre images you’ll ever see and what’s even crazier to me… is that no one is questioning it! How?! Why don’t we have an explanation for some of these mysteries captured in a photo? You don’t have to believe in aliens or anything of that sort, but when you see the Google Earth image that was captured in Utah, you can’t help but think that anything is possible. The image over Utah still gives me the creeps and literally feels like I get goosebumps; there’s just something off-putting about it. So, let’s get into the eerie spirit and dive down the rabbit hole of weird that is Google Earth in Idaho and surrounding states. "

Keeping tabs on the vegetation, water resources, and invasive species over these vast expanses can be daunting. Yet knowing the condition of the resources and grazing effects is essential to maintaining healthy rangelands and viable livestock operations. In addition, after implementing changes in grazing practices, managers need to be able to monitor the effects of those changes to determine whether they are achieving their objectives for production and rangeland health. Today’s Geographic Information System (GIS) technology offers tools to help manage and monitor private and public rangelands more efficiently. Google Earth Pro (GEP) is a free web-based program that enables users to view satellite imagery of rangeland, no matter how expansive or remote. Multiple layers of geographic information are available that can be imported to GEP, including land management boundaries and grazing allotments, fire history, core sage-grouse breeding and brood-rearing habitat, and other key wildlife habitat. Having this information at their fingertips could help ranchers manage rangelands more efficiently and sustainably. Maps also provide a valuable tool for communicating between ranchers and land management partners. Yet many landowners and even agency rangeland managers may not be aware of how to utilize GEP and GIS tools to develop land management and monitoring plans. Oregon State University Extension and University of Idaho Extension faculty collaborated to develop an Extension course that would provide ranchers with the skillset necessary to use GEP and GIS to improve range management. To make it as convenient as possible for busy land managers to take advantage of this training, OSU and UI Extension offer the GEP/GIS course in a hybrid format that combines classroom learning with self-paced online study and field exercises. The course helps producers become familiar with available technology and how to compile information they can use to make management decisions. Participants learn to use GEP/GIS tools to map their pastures and grazing allotments, analyze terrain when considering placement of roads, fences and water lines, and map weed infestations and treatments, for example. They also learn where to find and how to import GIS data such as fire history and core wildlife habitat that might influence their grazing management decisions. The course introduces users to INSIDE Idaho, a clearinghouse of available geospatial data. Course modules include rangeland management principles and photo monitoring techniques to help ranchers develop or improve their land management plans.

The stadium has also hosted the 's four times. Construction on the stadium began in 1936 as a project of the under President during the . The stadium was built to the immediate east of the baseball park , which opened in 1914. The stadium opened later in 1936 with a capacity of 8,900 as Orlando Stadium. The first college football bowl game was played on January 1, 1947. Catawba defeated Maryville 31–6 in the inaugural . 2,000 seats were added in 1952. During this period, the stadium was known as the Tangerine Bowl. 5,000 more seats were added in 1968, along with the first press box. From 1974 to 1976 an expansion project raised the capacity to 50,612, including a 3,600-seat upper deck on the east sidelines. However, shortly after completion the project proved to be a public fiasco and potentially an architectural and engineering failure. On November 27, 1976, the first major game was held at the expanded stadium, a regular season matchup between and . During the game, the newly-constructed upper deck noticeably swayed whenever fans stood up and cheered. The deck vibrated, fences and railings shook and creaked, causing an unnerving sensation for the patrons sitting in those sections. The swaying and shaking was noticeable again about a month later during the . The swaying was so pronounced that some fans vowed never to sit in those seats again, while some refused to return to the stadium at all. Before long, engineering evaluations, as well as legal investigations, uncovered numerous missteps, rushing, and cut corners in the stadium's design. While it was believed that the upper deck was structurally sound and met building codes, it nevertheless was deemed a failure. Additional problems included inadequate access to restrooms in the upper deck, gaps between the sections which required obstructive fences, and the fact that the upper deck was built at such an angle that it had poor sight lines. Meanwhile, unsightly I-beams installed to hold up the upper deck now blocked seats in the lower deck that were previously unobstructed. The maligned stadium's reputation was heavily tarnished after the upper deck scandal, criticized by public officials, media, and fans. Further complicating the situation was 's pending move to the stadium for . The city finally received a settlement of $900,500 from the stadium's engineers, architects, and designers, money that was soon appropriated for new improvements. The infamous steel east upper deck was dismantled in May 1980. After various new improvements, and a $30 million renovation that added new concrete upper decks to both sides, a capacity of 65,438 was established in 1989. In 1983, the Florida Department of Citrus was added as a title sponsor for the facility, at a price of $250,000. From 1999 to 2002, key stadium improvements included the addition of contour seating, two escalators, and a new 107-foot (33 m) wide scoreboard/video screen. A new sound system, along with two full-color ribbon displays along the upper decks, were also added. The expansion resulted in the upper deck overhanging Tinker Field's right field area, albeit at a significant height. Camping World Stadium has been home field to several short-lived teams. From 1966 to 1970, the stadium was home to the of the . In 1974, the of the played their only season in existence at the Tangerine Bowl. The played one season in 1985.

Lack of an agreement to rectify these issues led UCF to consider relocating, or spend considerable expense to upgrade the facility at its own cost. In addition, the stadium's capacity was seen as too large for UCF, leaving the stadium an appearance of being empty even with attendance of as much as 30,000–40,000 people per game.

The swaying was so pronounced that some fans vowed never to sit in those seats again, while some refused to return to the stadium at all.

While it was believed that the upper deck was structurally sound and met building codes, it nevertheless was deemed a failure. Additional problems included inadequate access to restrooms in the upper deck, gaps between the sections which required obstructive fences, and the fact that the upper deck was built at such an angle that it had poor sight lines. Meanwhile, unsightly I-beams installed to hold up the upper deck now blocked seats in the lower deck that were previously unobstructed.

Adding to its distinctive appearance are white patches of under the eyes. The fur on the rest of the body is dark to light brown above, with lighter fur on the underside. The platypus is common in waterways of eastern , where it generally feeds on bottom-dwelling but also takes an occasional , , or at the water’s surface. This shy creature forages most actively from dusk to dawn, sheltering during the day in dug into stream banks. It is exquisitely adapted for its aquatic lifestyle, having a flattened -like body, dense waterproof fur, and strong front limbs used for as well as digging. Even the head is , each ear being housed in a groove together with a small eye. The senses of sight, , and are essentially shut down while the platypus is submerged to feed, but it possesses a unique electromechanical system of and touch receptors that allow it to navigate perfectly underwater. Similar electroreceptors are also present in , which, together with the platypus, make up the mammalian order , a unique group with an exceptionally ancient history. Platypuses are generally solitary, spending their lives either feeding along the bottoms of , streams, and or resting in burrows dug into the banks. They are extremely energetic, feeding almost continuously while in the water, shoveling through streambed with their flat bills as they hunt for larval insects and freshwater (a favourite food). The platypus uses its sophisticated electromechanical system to detect minute electrical signals given off by the of its . After feeding, it retires to its burrow, the entrance of which is large enough to admit only the platypus and serves to squeeze excess moisture from the fur. The platypus is found in terrain ranging from the high country of and the to lowland areas close to the sea. Although it has on occasion been seen swimming in , the platypus must feed in fresh water, where its electrical navigation system is operative. The platypus is present in all eastern Australian states in both eastward- and westward-flowing river systems, but it is from far northern and, unlike its relatives, the , does not appear to have colonized the island of . Generally most active around dawn and dusk (crepuscular), platypuses can also be active during the day depending on the season, cloud cover, stream productivity, and even individual preference. Platypuses are not known to . However, they have an unusually low body temperature for mammals (about 32 °C ). Studies have shown that they can maintain a constant body temperature even after extended periods in water with temperatures as low as 4 °C (39 °F), a fact that puts to rest the belief that monotremes cannot regulate their body temperature. Platypuses range in length from 38 to 60 cm (15 to 24 inches); males are generally larger than females. Aquatic adaptations include the flat streamlined body, dorsally placed eyes and nostrils, and dense waterproof fur that keeps the platypus well insulated. Long guard hairs protect the soft underfur, which remains dry even after hours in the water. The extensive webbing on the front feet extends well past the claws and is essential in propelling the through the water. The paddlelike tail acts as a stabilizer during swimming, while the back feet act as rudders and brakes. Odd skeletal features of platypuses include an shoulder girdle and a short, wide humerus providing extensive muscle attachment areas for the exceptionally strong front limbs. The outside of the is covered by soft, sensitive skin. Inside the bill, adult platypuses do not have true teeth but instead have developed flat pads of hardened gum tissue. Male platypuses have a on the inner side of each ankle that is connected to a gland located over the thighs. The spurs can be wielded in defense, and the venom is enough to kill small animals and cause intense pain in humans if the spur penetrates the skin. "

The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, -billed, -tailed, -footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it, and the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body (in 1799) judged it a fake, made of several animals sewn together.

The common name platypus literally means 'flat-foot', deriving from the word platúpous ( ), from platús ( 'broad, wide, flat') and poús ( 'foot'). Shaw initially assigned the species the name Platypus anatinus when he described it, but the genus term was quickly discovered to already be in use as the name of the wood-boring genus .

Colloquially, the term platypi is also used for the plural, although this is a form of ; going by the word's Greek roots the plural would be platypodes. Early called it by many names, such as watermole, duckbill, and duckmole. Occasionally it is specifically called the duck-billed platypus. The scientific name Ornithorhynchus anatinus literally means 'duck-like bird-snout', deriving its from the Greek root ornith- ( ornith or ὄρνις órnīs 'bird') and the word rhúnkhos ( 'snout', 'beak'). Its is derived from Latin ('duck-like') from 'duck'. The platypus is the sole living representative or of its ( ). In 's account of the new colony 1788–1801, he describes coming across an amphibious animal, of the mole species. His account includes a drawing of the animal. The body and the broad, flat tail of the platypus are covered with dense, brown, biofluorescent that traps a layer of insulating air to keep the animal warm. The fur is waterproof, and the texture is akin to that of a . The platypus uses its tail for storage of fat reserves (an adaptation also found in animals such as the ). The is more significant on the front feet and is folded back when walking on land. The elongated snout and lower jaw are covered in soft skin, forming the bill. The nostrils are located on the dorsal surface of the snout, while the eyes and ears are located in a groove set just back from it; this groove is closed when swimming. Platypuses have been heard to emit a low growl when disturbed and a range of other vocalisations have been reported in captive specimens. Weight varies considerably from 0.7 to 2.4 kg (1 lb 9 oz to 5 lb 5 oz), with males being larger than females. Males average 50 cm (20 in) in total length, while females average 43 cm (17 in), with substantial variation in average size from one region to another. This pattern does not seem to follow any particular climatic rule and may be due to other environmental factors, such as predation and human encroachment. The platypus has an average of about 32 °C (90 °F) rather than the 37 °C (99 °F) typical of . Research suggests this has been a gradual adaptation to harsh environmental conditions on the part of the small number of surviving monotreme species rather than a historical characteristic of monotremes. Modern platypus young have three teeth in each of the (one premolar and two ) and (three molars), which they lose before or just after leaving the breeding burrow; adults have heavily pads called in their place, which they use to grind food. The first upper and third lower cheek teeth of platypus nestlings are small, each having one principal cusp, while the other teeth have two main cusps. The platypus is constructed differently from that of other mammals, and the jaw-opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound in the are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in pre mammalian . However, the external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw. The platypus has extra bones in the shoulder girdle, including an , which is not found in other mammals. As in many other aquatic and semiaquatic , the bones show , increasing their density to provide ballast. It has a gait, with the legs on the sides of the body, rather than underneath. When on land, it engages in on its front feet, to protect the webbing between the toes. While both male and female platypuses are born with ankle spurs, only the spurs on the male's back ankles deliver venom, composed largely of -like (DLPs), three of which are unique to the platypus. The DLPs are produced by the immune system of the platypus. The function of defensins is to cause in pathogenic bacteria and viruses, but in platypuses they also are formed into venom for defence. Although powerful enough to kill smaller animals such as dogs, the venom is not lethal to humans, but the pain is so excruciating that the victim may be incapacitated. rapidly develops around the wound and gradually spreads throughout the affected limb. Information obtained from and anecdotal evidence indicates the pain develops into a long-lasting (a heightened sensitivity to pain) that persists for days or even months. Venom is produced in the glands of the male, which are kidney-shaped connected by a thin-walled duct to a spur on each hind limb. The female platypus, in common with echidnas, has rudimentary spur buds that do not develop (dropping off before the end of their first year) and lack functional crural glands. The venom appears to have a different function from those produced by non-mammalian species; its effects are not life-threatening to humans, but nevertheless powerful enough to seriously impair the victim. Since only males produce venom and production rises during the breeding season, it may be used as an offensive weapon to assert dominance during this period. Similar spurs are found on many archaic mammal groups, indicating that this is an ancient characteristic for mammals as a whole, and not exclusive to the platypus or other monotremes. are the only mammals (apart from at least one species of -- ) known to have a sense of : they locate their prey in part by detecting electric fields generated by muscular contractions. The platypus's electroreception is the most sensitive of any monotreme. The are located in rostrocaudal rows in the skin of the bill, while (which detect touch) are uniformly distributed across the bill. The electrosensory area of the is contained within the tactile area, and some cortical cells receive input from both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors, suggesting a close association between the tactile and electric senses. Both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the bill dominate the of the platypus brain, in the same way human hands dominate the . The platypus can determine the direction of an electric source, perhaps by comparing differences in across the sheet of electroreceptors. This would explain the characteristic side-to-side motion of the animal's head while hunting. The cortical convergence of electrosensory and tactile inputs suggests a mechanism that determines the distance of prey that, when they move, emit both electrical signals and mechanical pressure pulses. The platypus uses the difference between arrival times of the two signals to sense distance. Feeding by neither sight nor smell, the platypus closes its eyes, ears, and nose each time it dives. Rather, when it digs in the bottom of streams with its bill, its electroreceptors detect tiny electric currents generated by muscular contractions of its prey, so enabling it to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, which continuously stimulate its mechanoreceptors. Experiments have shown the platypus will even react to an artificial shrimp if a small electric current is passed through it. Monotreme electrolocation probably evolved in order to allow the animals to forage in murky waters, and may be tied to their tooth loss. The extinct was electroreceptive, but unlike the modern platypus it foraged pelagically (near the ocean surface). In recent studies it has been suggested that the eyes of the platypus are more similar to those of or Northern Hemisphere than to those of most tetrapods. The eyes also contain , which most mammals do not have. Although the platypus's eyes are small and not used under water, several features indicate that vision played an important role in its ancestors. The surface and the adjacent surface of the lens is flat while the posterior surface of the lens is steeply curved, similar to the eyes of other aquatic mammals such as otters and sea-lions. A (ear side) concentration of , important for binocular vision, indicates a role in , while the accompanying visual acuity is insufficient for such activities. Furthermore, this limited acuity is matched by a low , a small and a large , suggesting that the plays a more important role than the , as in some rodents. These features suggest that the platypus has adapted to an aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle, developing its electrosensory system at the cost of its visual system; an evolutionary process paralleled by the small number of electroreceptors in the , which dwells in dry environments, whilst the , which lives in moist environments, is intermediate between the other two monotremes. In 2020, research in biofluorescence revealed that the platypus glows a bluish-green color when exposed to . The platypus is semiaquatic, inhabiting small streams and rivers over an extensive range from the cold highlands of and the to the of coastal as far north as the base of the . Inland, its distribution is not well known. It was considered extinct on the mainland, with the last sighting recorded at in 1975, until some years after had created (see ) in the 1980s, setting a platypus breeding program there, and it had subsequently closed. In 2017 there were some unconfirmed sightings downstream, outside the sanctuary, and in October 2020 a nesting platypus was filmed inside the recently reopened sanctuary. There is a population on introduced in the 1920s, which was said to stand at 150 individuals in the Rocky River region of before the , in which large portions of the island burnt, decimating all wildlife. However, with the recovery teams working hard to reinstate their habitat, there had been a number of sightings reported by April 2020. The platypus is no longer found in the main part of the , possibly due to the declining brought about by extensive land clearing and schemes. Along the coastal river systems, its distribution is unpredictable; it appears to be absent from some relatively healthy rivers, and yet maintains a presence in others, for example, the lower , that are quite degraded. In captivity, platypuses have survived to 17 years of age, and wild specimens have been recaptured when 11 years old. for adults in the wild appear to be low. Natural predators include , , , , , and . Low platypus numbers in northern Australia are possibly due to predation by . The introduction of in 1845 for hunting may have had some impact on its numbers on the mainland. The platypus is generally regarded as and , but individuals are also active during the day, particularly when the sky is overcast. Its habitat bridges and the for both a food supply of prey species, and banks where it can dig resting and nesting burrows. It may have a range of up to 7 km (4.3 mi), with a male's home range overlapping those of three or four females. The platypus is an excellent swimmer and spends much of its time in the water foraging for food. It has a very characteristic swimming style and no external ears. Uniquely among mammals, it propels itself when swimming by an alternate rowing motion of the front feet; although all four feet of the platypus are webbed, the hind feet (which are held against the body) do not assist in propulsion, but are used for steering in combination with the tail. The species is , maintaining its body temperature at about 32 °C (90 °F), lower than most mammals, even while foraging for hours in water below 5 °C (41 °F). Dives normally last around 30 seconds, but can last longer, although few exceed the estimated aerobic limit of 40 seconds. Recovery at the surface between dives commonly takes from 10 to 20 seconds. When not in the water, the platypus retires to a short, straight resting burrow of oval cross-section, nearly always in the riverbank not far above water level, and often under a protective tangle of roots. The average sleep time of a platypus is said to be as long as 14 hours per day, possibly because it eats , which provide a high level of calories. The platypus is a : it feeds on worms, , freshwater , and ( ) that it digs out of the riverbed with its snout or catches while swimming. It uses cheek-pouches to carry prey to the surface, where it is eaten. The platypus needs to eat about 20% of its own weight each day, which requires it to spend an average of 12 hours daily looking for food. When the platypus was first encountered by European , they were divided over whether the female lays eggs. This was finally confirmed by 's team in 1884. The species exhibits a single ; mating occurs between June and October, with some local variation taking place between different populations across its range. Historical observation, studies, and preliminary investigations of population genetics indicate the possibility of both resident and transient members of populations, and suggest a mating system. Females are thought likely to become sexually mature in their second year, with breeding confirmed still to take place in animals over nine years old. Outside the mating season, the platypus lives in a simple ground burrow, the entrance of which is about 30 cm (12 in) above the water level. After mating, the female constructs a deeper, more elaborate burrow up to 20 m (65 ft) long and blocked at intervals with plugs (which may act as a safeguard against rising waters or predators, or as a method of regulating humidity and temperature). The male takes no part in caring for his young, and retreats to his year-long burrow. The female softens the ground in the burrow with dead, folded, wet leaves, and she fills the nest at the end of the tunnel with fallen leaves and reeds for bedding material. This material is dragged to the nest by tucking it underneath her curled tail. The female platypus has a pair of , but only the left one is functional. The platypus's genes are a possible evolutionary link between the mammalian and bird/reptile sex-determination systems because one of the platypus's five X chromosomes contains the gene, which birds possess on their Z chromosome. It lays one to three (usually two) small, leathery eggs (similar to those of reptiles), about 11 mm ( 7⁄16 in) in diameter and slightly rounder than bird eggs. The eggs develop for about 28 days, with only about 10 days of external (in contrast to a chicken egg, which spends about one day in tract and 21 days externally). After laying her eggs, the female curls around them. The incubation period is divided into three phases. In the first phase, the has no functional organs and relies on the for sustenance. The yolk is absorbed by the developing young. During the second phase, the digits develop, and in the last phase, the appears. Most mammal zygotes go through cleavage, meaning that, following fertilization, the ovum is split due to cell divisions into multiple, divisible daughter cells. This is in comparison to the more ancestral process of cleavage, present in like the platypus and in non-mammals like . In meroblastic cleavage, the ovum does not split completely. This causes the cells at the edge of the yolk to be cytoplasmically continuous with the egg's cytoplasm. This allows the yolk, which contains the embryo, to exchange waste and nutrients with the cytoplasm. There is no official term for platypus young, but the term platypup sees unofficial use, as does puggle. Newly hatched platypuses are vulnerable, blind, and hairless, and are fed by the mother's milk. Although possessing , the platypus lacks teats. Instead, milk is released through pores in the skin. The milk pools in grooves on her abdomen, allowing the young to lap it up. After they hatch, the offspring are milk-fed for three to four months. During incubation and weaning, the mother initially leaves the burrow only for short periods, to forage. When doing so, she creates a number of thin soil plugs along the length of the burrow, possibly to protect the young from predators; pushing past these on her return forces water from her fur and allows the burrow to remain dry. After about five weeks, the mother begins to spend more time away from her young, and at around four months, the young emerge from the burrow. A platypus is born with teeth, but these drop out at a very early age, leaving the horny plates it uses to grind food. Platypus The platypus and other monotremes were very poorly understood, and some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them – for example, that the monotremes were inferior or – still endure. In 1947, theorised that placental mammals and marsupials may have diverged earlier, and a subsequent branching divided the monotremes and marsupials, but later research and fossil discoveries have suggested this is incorrect. In fact, modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree, and a later branching is thought to have led to the and placental groups. and fossil dating suggest platypuses split from around 19–48 million years ago. The oldest discovered fossil of the modern platypus dates back to about 100,000 years ago, during the period. The extinct monotremes and were once thought to be closely related to the modern platypus, but are now considered more basal taxa. The fossilised Steropodon was discovered in and is composed of an opalised lower jawbone with three molar teeth (whereas the adult contemporary platypus is toothless). The molar teeth were initially thought to be , which would have supported a variation of Gregory's theory, but later research has suggested, while they have three cusps, they evolved under a separate process. The fossil is thought to be about 110 million years old, making it the oldest mammal fossil found in Australia. Unlike the modern platypus (and ), Teinolophos lacked a beak. , another fossil relative of the platypus, has been found in , indicating monotremes were present in the supercontinent of when the continents of and Australia were joined via (until about 167 million years ago). A fossilised tooth of a giant platypus species, , was dated 5–15 million years ago. Judging by the tooth, the animal measured 1.3 metres long, making it the largest platypus on record. Because of the early divergence from the and the low numbers of extant monotreme species, the platypus is a frequent subject of research in evolutionary biology. In 2004, at the discovered the platypus has ten , compared with two (XY) in most other mammals. These ten chromosomes form five unique pairs of XY in males and XX in females, i.e. males are X 1 Y 1 X 2 Y 2 X 3 Y 3 X 4 Y 4 X 5 Y 5 . One of the X chromosomes of the platypus has great homology to the bird Z chromosome. The platypus genome also has both reptilian and mammalian genes associated with egg fertilisation. Though the platypus lacks the mammalian sex-determining gene , a study found that the mechanism of sex determination is the on the oldest . A draft version of the platypus genome sequence was published in on 8 May 2008, revealing both reptilian and mammalian elements, as well as two genes found previously only in birds, amphibians, and fish. More than 80% of the platypus's genes are common to the other mammals whose genomes have been sequenced. An updated genome, the most complete on record, was published in 2021, together with the genome of the . Except for its loss from the state of South Australia, the platypus occupies the same general distribution as it did prior to . However, local changes and fragmentation of distribution due to human modification of its habitat are documented. Its historical abundance is unknown and its current abundance difficult to gauge, but it is assumed to have declined in numbers, although as of 1998 was still being considered as common over most of its current range. The species was extensively hunted for its fur until the early years of the 20th century and, although protected throughout Australia since 1905, until about 1950 it was still at risk of drowning in the nets of inland . The recategorised its status as near threatened in 2016. The species is protected by law, but the only state in which it is listed as endangered is South Australia, under the . In 2020 it has been recommended to be listed as a vulnerable species in Victoria under the state's . The platypus is not considered to be in immediate danger of extinction, because conservation measures have been successful, but it could be adversely affected by habitat disruption caused by , , , netting, and trapping. Reduction of watercourse flows and water levels through excessive droughts and extraction of water for industrial, agricultural, and domestic supplies are also considered a threat. The lists the platypus on its as as assessed in 2016, when it was estimated that numbers had reduced by about 30 percent on average since European settlement. The animal is listed as endangered in South Australia, but it is not covered at all under the federal . Researchers have worried for years that declines have been greater than assumed. In January 2020, researchers from the presented evidence that the platypus is at risk of , due to a combination of extraction of , , and severe . The study predicted that, considering current threats, the animals' abundance would decline by 47%–66% and occupancy by 22%–32% over 50 years, causing extinction of local populations across about 40% of the range. Under projections of climate change projections to 2070, reduced habitat due to drought would lead to 51–73% reduced abundance and 36–56% reduced metapopulation occupancy within 50 years respectively. These predictions suggested that the species would fall under the Vulnerable classification. The authors stressed the need for national conservation efforts, which might include conducting more surveys, tracking trends, reduction of threats and improvement of river management to ensure healthy platypus habitat. Co-author Gilad Bino is concerned that the estimates of the 2016 baseline numbers could be wrong, and numbers may have been reduced by as much as half already. A November 2020 report by scientists from the , funded by a research grant from the in collaboration with the and the revealed that that platypus habitat in Australia had shrunk by 22 per cent in the previous 30 years, and recommended that the platypus should be listed as a threatened species under the EPBC Act . Declines in population had been greatest in NSW, in particular in the . Platypuses generally suffer from few in the wild; however, as of 2008 there was concern in Tasmania about the potential impacts of a disease caused by the fungus . The disease (termed ) affects only Tasmanian platypuses, and had not been observed in platypuses in mainland Australia. Affected platypuses can develop skin lesions or on various parts of their bodies, including their backs, tails, and legs. Mucormycosis can kill platypuses, death arising from secondary infection and by affecting the animals' ability to maintain body temperature and forage efficiently. The Biodiversity Conservation Branch at the Department of Primary Industries and Water collaborated with NRM north and researchers to determine the impacts of the disease on Tasmanian platypuses, as well as the mechanism of transmission and spread of the disease. Much of the world was introduced to the platypus in 1939 when published an article on the platypus and the efforts to study and raise it in captivity. The latter is a difficult task, and only a few young have been successfully raised since, notably at in . The leading figure in these efforts was , who established a platypusary (a simulated stream in a tank) at the Healesville Sanctuary, where breeding was successful in 1943. In 1972, he found a dead baby of about 50 days old, which had presumably been born in captivity, at his at on the , Queensland. Healesville repeated its success in 1998 and again in 2000 with a similar stream tank. Since 2008, platypus has bred regularly at Healesville, including second-generation (captive born themselves breeding in captivity). in bred twins in 2003, and breeding was again successful there in 2006. As of 2019, the only platypuses in captivity outside of Australia are in the in the of . Three attempts were made to bring the animals to the , in 1922, 1947, and 1958; of these, only two of the three animals introduced in 1947 lived longer than eighteen months. used to hunt platypuses for food (their fatty tails being particularly nutritious), while, after colonisation, Europeans hunted them for fur from the late 19th century and until 1912, when it was prohibited by law. In addition, European researchers captured and killed platypus or removed their eggs, partly in order to increase scientific knowledge, but also to gain prestige and outcompete rivals from different countries. The platypus has been a subject in the stories of , some of whom believed the animal was a hybrid of a duck and a . : 57–60 According to one story of the upper , the major animal groups, the land animals, water animals and birds, all competed for the platypus to join their respective groups, but the platypus ultimately decided to not join any of them, feeling that he did not need to be part of a group to be special, : 83–85 and wished to remain friends with all of those groups. Another Dreaming story emanate of the upper Darling tells of a young duck which ventured too far, ignoring the warnings of her tribe, and was kidnapped by a large water-rat called Biggoon. After managing to escape after some time, she returned and laid two eggs which hatched into strange furry creatures, so they were all banished and went to live in the mountains. The platypus is also used by some as a , which is to them a natural object, plant or animal that is inherited by members of a clan or family as their spiritual emblem, and the animal holds special meaning as a totem animal for the people, who live along the . Because of their cultural significance and importance in , the platypus is protected and conserved by these Indigenous peoples. The platypus has often been used as a symbol of Australia's . In the 1940s, live platypuses were given to allies in the , in order to strengthen ties and boost morale. Platypuses have been used several times as mascots: Syd the platypus was one of the three mascots chosen for the along with an echidna and a , Expo Oz the platypus was the mascot for , which was held in in 1988, and the platypus is the mascot for the operating system, the -based core of and other operating systems from Since the introduction of to in 1966, the embossed image of a platypus, designed and sculpted by , has appeared on the reverse (tails) side of the . The platypus has frequently appeared in Australian postage stamps, most recently the 2015 Native Animals series and the 2016 Australian Animals Monotremes series. In the American animated series (2007–2015), the own a pet bluish-green platypus named who, unknown to them, is a secret agent. Such choices were inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit the animal's striking appearance; additionally, show creator , who also wrote the character's theme song, said that its opening lyrics are based on the introductory sentence of the Platypus article on Wikipedia, copying the semiaquatic egg-laying mammal phrase word for word, and appending the phrase of action. As a character, Perry has been well received by both fans and critics. Coincidentally, real platypuses show a similar cyan color when seen under ultraviolet lighting. "

        "html_text": "Sometimes known as a duck-billed platypus, this curious mammal combines the characteristics of many different species in one. The platypus is a duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed, egg-laying aquatic creature native to Australia. If its appearance alone somehow fails to impress, the male of the species is also one of the world’s few venomous mammals! Equipped with sharp stingers on the heels of its hind feet, the male platypus can deliver a strong toxic blow to any approaching foe. While the platypus generally inhabits freshwater rivers, wetlands, and Down Under, it is also known to venture into brackish (the combined fresh-and saltwater areas where rivers meet the sea). The platypus is a bottom-feeder that uses its beaver-like tail to steer and its webbed feet to propel itself through the water while hunting for insects, shellfish, and worms. The watertight nostrils on its bill remain sealed so that the animal can stay submerged for up to two minutes as it forages for food. The bill also comes equipped with specialized nerve endings, called electroreceptors, which detect tiny electrical currents generated by the muscular contractions of prey. It has no teeth, so the platypus stores its catch in its cheek pouches, returns to the surface, mashes up its meal with the help of gravel bits hoovered up enroute, then swallows it all down. The female platypus lays her eggs in an underground burrow that she digs near the water’s edge. Baby platypuses hatch after 10 days and nurse for up to four months before they swim off and forage on their own. The Commonwealth of Australia reveres this remarkable mammal so much that it honors the platypus with a place on its . Did you know? There is only one other egg-laying mammal in the world. The , a distant cousin of the anteater, also lays eggs and is found in Australia and New Guinea. Both the platypus and the echnida are monotremes, meaning that they lay eggs and have a single opening (cloaca) for reproduction and elimination of wastes. Last updated: 01/20/23 Author: NOAA "

The platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom. The platypus has a paddle-shaped tail, like a ; a sleek, furry body, like an ; and a flat bill and webbed feet, like a duck. In fact, the first time a stuffed platypus was brought from Australia to Britain, people couldn't believe it was a real animal; they thought a trickster had sewn two animals together, according to London's (opens in new tab) . Platypuses (which is the correct plural form, not platypi) are among the few venomous mammals. Males have a spur, connected to a venom-secreting gland, on each hind foot. More venom is secreted during mating season, leading researchers to think that the spurs and venom help males compete for mates, according to the (opens in new tab) . The venom is not life-threatening to humans, but it can cause severe swelling and excruciating pain. Related: Adult male platypuses can range between about 15.7 inches to 24.8 inches (39.8 to 62.9 centimeters) long, from the tip of the bill to tip of the tail, according to the (opens in new tab) . Adult females range from 14.5 to 21.6 inches (36.8 to 54.8 cm) long. Adult males weigh about 1.7 to 6.6 lbs. (0.8 to 3 kilograms) and females weigh about 1.3 to 3.7 lbs. (0.6 to 1,7 kg). Scientists have found fossils that suggest that ancient platypuses were significantly larger than the modern variety, at about 3.3 feet (1 meter) long, . Platypuses have dense, thick fur that helps them stay warm underwater. Most of the fur is dark brown, except for a patch of lighter fur near each eye and lighter-colored fur on the underside. Under light, however, platypuses' drab brown fur glows green and blue, (opens in new tab) . It's possible that this biofluorescence helps reduce the animals' visibility to predators, but the eerie glow may serve little or no ecological function. Scientists are still investigating this question. A platypus's front feet have extra skin that acts like a paddle when the animal is swimming. When platypuses are on land, their webbing retracts, making the claws more pronounced, according to (opens in new tab) . The animals walk on their knuckles to protect the webbing, according to a 2001 report in the (opens in new tab) . The bill of a platypus resembles that of a duck and has a smooth texture that feels like suede. It is also flexible and rubbery. The skin of the bill holds tens of thousands of sensory receptors that help the platypus navigate underwater and detect movement of potential food, such as shrimp, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Male platypuses carry venom glands, located near their pelvises, that connect to hollow spurs on their hind legs, according to a (opens in new tab) a toxinologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia. Young females also have these spurs, but they lose them in the first year of life. The venom glands of adult males fluctuate in size throughout the year, reaching their maximum size during breeding season, when males use their venom to compete for mates. To inject its venom, a male wraps its legs around its victim and drives the spurs through the animal's flesh, according to op den Brouw. The venom itself contains a cocktail of more than a dozen proteins that belong to three major classes of toxins, op den Brouw wrote. This venom is not lethal to platypuses or humans, but it causes swelling and excruciating pain, and it can disrupt wound healing and the function of cell membranes, she noted. In humans, the pain from a platypus sting can be treated with nerve blockers, which block specific nerve cells from sending signals to the . Platypuses live in Australia in a range that extends from western Victoria to about as far north as Cooktown in Queensland, meaning they occupy a large stretch of the east and southeast coast of the country, according to the (opens in new tab) . The creatures can also be found on Tasmania and King Island, as well as on Kangaroo Island, where platypuses were introduced by humans in the early 1900s. Platypuses occupy freshwater systems — including river basins, lakes, ponds and streams — throughout their habitat range. The animals spend about 10 to 12 hours a night in the water, hunting for food; they are most active during nighttime and dusk, because they are nocturnal. They can stay underwater for only 30 to 140 seconds, the Australian Museum notes. During the day, they hide out in burrows on the shore, where earthen tunnels open up into oval-shaped underground chambers, according to the (opens in new tab) . Platypuses also take shelter under rock ledges, roots and debris, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Though they exist on only one side of one continent, platypuses weather many climatic extremes. They have been found in plateaus, lowlands, tropical rainforests, and the cold mountains of Tasmania and the Australian Alps. Platypuses' waterproof, thick fur keeps them warm in chilly weather, and their big tails store extra fat for energy, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Platypuses are carnivorous, which means they eat meat but not plants. They hunt for their food in the water where they live. As they swim, they detect food along the muddy bottom of the river, stream, pond or lake using only their sensitive bills, since the animals actually close their eyes, ears and nostrils while foraging underwater, according to the Australian Museum. When platypuses find something interesting, like insect larvae, they scoop it up in their bills, store it in their cheek pouches and swim to the surface. The animals also eat shrimp, swimming beetles, water bugs and tadpoles, as well as the occasional worm, freshwater pea mussel or snail. Platypuses have even been observed eating cicadas and moths that they catch at the water's surface, according to the Australian Museum. After coming up from a dive, platypuses float atop the water and chew their food using grinding plates in their mouths. The animals sometimes pick up mud and sand in their cheek pouches, and as they eat, they expel this inedible sediment, along with excess water, through grooves in their lower jaws, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Most mammals give birth to live young. Platypuses, however, lay eggs. Mammals that lay eggs are known as monotremes, and besides the platypus, the only other monotremes are , or spiny anteaters, according to the University of Melbourne. Echidnas are found only in Australia and New Guinea. When female platypuses are ready to have their young, they burrow inside the ground on the riverbank and seal themselves into tunnel rooms. Each female then lays one to three eggs and places them between her rump and her tail to keep them warm. After about 10 days, the eggs hatch and the bean-size babies nurse for three to four months inside their burrow, according to the Australian Museum. Around the time of weaning, baby platypuses can swim on their own, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Here is the taxonomy of the platypus, according to the (opens in new tab) (ITIS): Platypuses are not endangered, but the (opens in new tab) (IUCN) lists them as near threatened, meaning the species may be vulnerable to extinction in the near future but does not currently qualify as threatened. The platypus was first listed as near threatened in 2016 after scientists observed a decline in the species' overall numbers, although the decline is poorly defined and inconsistent across the platypus's range, the Australian Platypus Conservatory notes on its website.

It is an egg-laying mammal with a sleek furry body, paddle-shaped tail, webbed feet, and a flat bill. A Platypus is one of the few on earth. The female platypuses are 17 inches long while the male can attain a maximum length of about 20 inches. The weight of the platypus varies from 1.5 pounds to 5.3 pounds with the females being lighter than the male. Platypus feed on insect larvae, freshwater yabby, annelid worms, and freshwater shrimps. Platypuses build their homes in the freshwater regions of the southeastern and eastern Australian coasts and the island of . Although they spend most of their time in the water, these creatures swim to the riverbanks and dig tunnels with chambers. These creatures are that are quite active at night and dusk; therefore they spend their day sleeping in the burrows. Some platypuses reside under debris, roots or rocks. Platypuses are active all year long, and during their waterproof fur keeps them warm while their tails store fats for energy. Even though they exist in one corner of the continent, platypuses can survive numerous climate conditions. Their habitat stretches west from the tropical rainforest area of to the Australian Alps. They also occupy the colder highland regions and the rainforest habitat of Tasmania. Although platypuses reside in a wide variety of habitats, they are primarily found in the freshwater rivers and lakes of the rainforest region of Queensland. Platypus population was introduced on in Flinders Chase National Park from 1928 to 1946. Platypuses reside in the east-flowing river systems and about 80% of all the west-flowing river systems in . They are also present in approximately 80% of rivers in and 33% of Queensland’s river basins. They are also found in the rivers of King Island which is isolated from Tasmania and Victoria by the . Other than the low platypus population in , these creatures still occupy the same general distribution they did before the European settlements were built in the region. Platypuses no longer live in the wild in the southern parts of the Australian mainland; however, some few species that swim along River Murray find their way into the state. The absence of these species in the western and northern parts of South Australia reflects on the lack of reliable surface water source in this region. Severe flooding and predation by the have reduced their population in Northern parts of Australia. Platypuses appear to be extinct in the Mount Lofty and Adelaide hills ranges in South Australia and also in the River Avoca basin. There were no platypuses living in captivity outside Australia, as of 2017. Three attempts to introduce platypus in Bronx Zoo were made in 1958, 1947, and 1922, but just 2 out of the 3 platypuses introduced in the zoo lived for over one and a half years.

Adding to its distinctive appearance are white patches of under the eyes. The fur on the rest of the body is dark to light brown above, with lighter fur on the underside. The platypus is common in waterways of eastern , where it generally feeds on bottom-dwelling but also takes an occasional , , or at the water’s surface. This shy creature forages most actively from dusk to dawn, sheltering during the day in dug into stream banks. It is exquisitely adapted for its aquatic lifestyle, having a flattened -like body, dense waterproof fur, and strong front limbs used for as well as digging. Even the head is , each ear being housed in a groove together with a small eye. The senses of sight, , and are essentially shut down while the platypus is submerged to feed, but it possesses a unique electromechanical system of and touch receptors that allow it to navigate perfectly underwater. Similar electroreceptors are also present in , which, together with the platypus, make up the mammalian order , a unique group with an exceptionally ancient history. Platypuses are generally solitary, spending their lives either feeding along the bottoms of , streams, and or resting in burrows dug into the banks. They are extremely energetic, feeding almost continuously while in the water, shoveling through streambed with their flat bills as they hunt for larval insects and freshwater (a favourite food). The platypus uses its sophisticated electromechanical system to detect minute electrical signals given off by the of its . After feeding, it retires to its burrow, the entrance of which is large enough to admit only the platypus and serves to squeeze excess moisture from the fur. The platypus is found in terrain ranging from the high country of and the to lowland areas close to the sea. Although it has on occasion been seen swimming in , the platypus must feed in fresh water, where its electrical navigation system is operative. The platypus is present in all eastern Australian states in both eastward- and westward-flowing river systems, but it is from far northern and, unlike its relatives, the , does not appear to have colonized the island of . Generally most active around dawn and dusk (crepuscular), platypuses can also be active during the day depending on the season, cloud cover, stream productivity, and even individual preference. Platypuses are not known to . However, they have an unusually low body temperature for mammals (about 32 °C ). Studies have shown that they can maintain a constant body temperature even after extended periods in water with temperatures as low as 4 °C (39 °F), a fact that puts to rest the belief that monotremes cannot regulate their body temperature. Platypuses range in length from 38 to 60 cm (15 to 24 inches); males are generally larger than females. Aquatic adaptations include the flat streamlined body, dorsally placed eyes and nostrils, and dense waterproof fur that keeps the platypus well insulated. Long guard hairs protect the soft underfur, which remains dry even after hours in the water. The extensive webbing on the front feet extends well past the claws and is essential in propelling the through the water. The paddlelike tail acts as a stabilizer during swimming, while the back feet act as rudders and brakes. Odd skeletal features of platypuses include an shoulder girdle and a short, wide humerus providing extensive muscle attachment areas for the exceptionally strong front limbs. The outside of the is covered by soft, sensitive skin. Inside the bill, adult platypuses do not have true teeth but instead have developed flat pads of hardened gum tissue. Male platypuses have a on the inner side of each ankle that is connected to a gland located over the thighs. The spurs can be wielded in defense, and the venom is enough to kill small animals and cause intense pain in humans if the spur penetrates the skin. "

The platypus is the sole living representative or of its ( ) and ( Ornithorhynchus ), though a number of appear in the fossil record.

It is one of the few species of , as the male platypus has a on the hind foot that delivers a , capable of causing severe pain to humans. The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, -billed, -tailed, -footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it, and the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body (in 1799) judged it a fake, made of several animals sewn together. The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of , and a recognisable and iconic symbol of . It is culturally significant to several , who also used to hunt the animal for food. It has appeared as a mascot at national events and features on the of the , and the platypus is the animal emblem of the state of . Until the early 20th century, humans hunted the platypus for its fur, but it is now protected throughout its range. Although programs have had only limited success, and the platypus is vulnerable to the effects of pollution, it is not under any immediate threat. As of 2020 , the platypus is a legally in all states where it occurs. It is listed as an in and in . The species is classified as a by the , but a November 2020 report has recommended that it is upgraded to under the federal , due to and declining numbers in all states. When the platypus was first encountered by Europeans in 1798, a and sketch were sent back to by , the second Governor of . British scientists' initial hunch was that the attributes were a hoax. , who produced the first description of the animal in the Naturalist's Miscellany in 1799, stated it was impossible not to entertain doubts as to its genuine nature, and believed it might have been produced by some Asian . It was thought that somebody had sewn a duck's beak onto the body of a beaver-like animal. Shaw even took a pair of scissors to the dried skin to check for stitches. The common name platypus literally means 'flat-foot', deriving from the word platúpous ( ), from platús ( 'broad, wide, flat') and poús ( 'foot'). Shaw initially assigned the species the name Platypus anatinus when he described it, but the genus term was quickly discovered to already be in use as the name of the wood-boring genus . It was independently described as Ornithorhynchus paradoxus by in 1800 (from a specimen given to him by ) and following the of nomenclature, it was later officially recognised as Ornithorhynchus anatinus . There is no universally-agreed plural form of platypus in the English language. Scientists generally use platypuses or simply platypus. Colloquially, the term platypi is also used for the plural, although this is a form of ; going by the word's Greek roots the plural would be platypodes. Early called it by many names, such as watermole, duckbill, and duckmole. Occasionally it is specifically called the duck-billed platypus. The scientific name Ornithorhynchus anatinus literally means 'duck-like bird-snout', deriving its from the Greek root ornith- ( ornith or ὄρνις órnīs 'bird') and the word rhúnkhos ( 'snout', 'beak'). Its is derived from Latin ('duck-like') from 'duck'. The platypus is the sole living representative or of its ( ). In 's account of the new colony 1788–1801, he describes coming across an amphibious animal, of the mole species. His account includes a drawing of the animal. The body and the broad, flat tail of the platypus are covered with dense, brown, biofluorescent that traps a layer of insulating air to keep the animal warm. The fur is waterproof, and the texture is akin to that of a . The platypus uses its tail for storage of fat reserves (an adaptation also found in animals such as the ). The is more significant on the front feet and is folded back when walking on land. The elongated snout and lower jaw are covered in soft skin, forming the bill. The nostrils are located on the dorsal surface of the snout, while the eyes and ears are located in a groove set just back from it; this groove is closed when swimming. Platypuses have been heard to emit a low growl when disturbed and a range of other vocalisations have been reported in captive specimens. Weight varies considerably from 0.7 to 2.4 kg (1 lb 9 oz to 5 lb 5 oz), with males being larger than females. Males average 50 cm (20 in) in total length, while females average 43 cm (17 in), with substantial variation in average size from one region to another. This pattern does not seem to follow any particular climatic rule and may be due to other environmental factors, such as predation and human encroachment. The platypus has an average of about 32 °C (90 °F) rather than the 37 °C (99 °F) typical of . Research suggests this has been a gradual adaptation to harsh environmental conditions on the part of the small number of surviving monotreme species rather than a historical characteristic of monotremes. Modern platypus young have three teeth in each of the (one premolar and two ) and (three molars), which they lose before or just after leaving the breeding burrow; adults have heavily pads called in their place, which they use to grind food. The first upper and third lower cheek teeth of platypus nestlings are small, each having one principal cusp, while the other teeth have two main cusps. The platypus is constructed differently from that of other mammals, and the jaw-opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound in the are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in pre mammalian . However, the external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw. The platypus has extra bones in the shoulder girdle, including an , which is not found in other mammals. As in many other aquatic and semiaquatic , the bones show , increasing their density to provide ballast. It has a gait, with the legs on the sides of the body, rather than underneath. When on land, it engages in on its front feet, to protect the webbing between the toes. While both male and female platypuses are born with ankle spurs, only the spurs on the male's back ankles deliver venom, composed largely of -like (DLPs), three of which are unique to the platypus. The DLPs are produced by the immune system of the platypus. The function of defensins is to cause in pathogenic bacteria and viruses, but in platypuses they also are formed into venom for defence. Although powerful enough to kill smaller animals such as dogs, the venom is not lethal to humans, but the pain is so excruciating that the victim may be incapacitated. rapidly develops around the wound and gradually spreads throughout the affected limb. Information obtained from and anecdotal evidence indicates the pain develops into a long-lasting (a heightened sensitivity to pain) that persists for days or even months. Venom is produced in the glands of the male, which are kidney-shaped connected by a thin-walled duct to a spur on each hind limb. The female platypus, in common with echidnas, has rudimentary spur buds that do not develop (dropping off before the end of their first year) and lack functional crural glands. The venom appears to have a different function from those produced by non-mammalian species; its effects are not life-threatening to humans, but nevertheless powerful enough to seriously impair the victim. Since only males produce venom and production rises during the breeding season, it may be used as an offensive weapon to assert dominance during this period. Similar spurs are found on many archaic mammal groups, indicating that this is an ancient characteristic for mammals as a whole, and not exclusive to the platypus or other monotremes. are the only mammals (apart from at least one species of -- ) known to have a sense of : they locate their prey in part by detecting electric fields generated by muscular contractions. The platypus's electroreception is the most sensitive of any monotreme. The are located in rostrocaudal rows in the skin of the bill, while (which detect touch) are uniformly distributed across the bill. The electrosensory area of the is contained within the tactile area, and some cortical cells receive input from both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors, suggesting a close association between the tactile and electric senses. Both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the bill dominate the of the platypus brain, in the same way human hands dominate the . The platypus can determine the direction of an electric source, perhaps by comparing differences in across the sheet of electroreceptors. This would explain the characteristic side-to-side motion of the animal's head while hunting. The cortical convergence of electrosensory and tactile inputs suggests a mechanism that determines the distance of prey that, when they move, emit both electrical signals and mechanical pressure pulses. The platypus uses the difference between arrival times of the two signals to sense distance. Feeding by neither sight nor smell, the platypus closes its eyes, ears, and nose each time it dives. Rather, when it digs in the bottom of streams with its bill, its electroreceptors detect tiny electric currents generated by muscular contractions of its prey, so enabling it to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, which continuously stimulate its mechanoreceptors. Experiments have shown the platypus will even react to an artificial shrimp if a small electric current is passed through it. Monotreme electrolocation probably evolved in order to allow the animals to forage in murky waters, and may be tied to their tooth loss. The extinct was electroreceptive, but unlike the modern platypus it foraged pelagically (near the ocean surface). In recent studies it has been suggested that the eyes of the platypus are more similar to those of or Northern Hemisphere than to those of most tetrapods. The eyes also contain , which most mammals do not have. Although the platypus's eyes are small and not used under water, several features indicate that vision played an important role in its ancestors. The surface and the adjacent surface of the lens is flat while the posterior surface of the lens is steeply curved, similar to the eyes of other aquatic mammals such as otters and sea-lions. A (ear side) concentration of , important for binocular vision, indicates a role in , while the accompanying visual acuity is insufficient for such activities. Furthermore, this limited acuity is matched by a low , a small and a large , suggesting that the plays a more important role than the , as in some rodents. These features suggest that the platypus has adapted to an aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle, developing its electrosensory system at the cost of its visual system; an evolutionary process paralleled by the small number of electroreceptors in the , which dwells in dry environments, whilst the , which lives in moist environments, is intermediate between the other two monotremes. In 2020, research in biofluorescence revealed that the platypus glows a bluish-green color when exposed to . The platypus is semiaquatic, inhabiting small streams and rivers over an extensive range from the cold highlands of and the to the of coastal as far north as the base of the . Inland, its distribution is not well known. It was considered extinct on the mainland, with the last sighting recorded at in 1975, until some years after had created (see ) in the 1980s, setting a platypus breeding program there, and it had subsequently closed. In 2017 there were some unconfirmed sightings downstream, outside the sanctuary, and in October 2020 a nesting platypus was filmed inside the recently reopened sanctuary. There is a population on introduced in the 1920s, which was said to stand at 150 individuals in the Rocky River region of before the , in which large portions of the island burnt, decimating all wildlife. However, with the recovery teams working hard to reinstate their habitat, there had been a number of sightings reported by April 2020. The platypus is no longer found in the main part of the , possibly due to the declining brought about by extensive land clearing and schemes. Along the coastal river systems, its distribution is unpredictable; it appears to be absent from some relatively healthy rivers, and yet maintains a presence in others, for example, the lower , that are quite degraded. In captivity, platypuses have survived to 17 years of age, and wild specimens have been recaptured when 11 years old. for adults in the wild appear to be low. Natural predators include , , , , , and . Low platypus numbers in northern Australia are possibly due to predation by . The introduction of in 1845 for hunting may have had some impact on its numbers on the mainland. The platypus is generally regarded as and , but individuals are also active during the day, particularly when the sky is overcast. Its habitat bridges and the for both a food supply of prey species, and banks where it can dig resting and nesting burrows. It may have a range of up to 7 km (4.3 mi), with a male's home range overlapping those of three or four females. The platypus is an excellent swimmer and spends much of its time in the water foraging for food. It has a very characteristic swimming style and no external ears. Uniquely among mammals, it propels itself when swimming by an alternate rowing motion of the front feet; although all four feet of the platypus are webbed, the hind feet (which are held against the body) do not assist in propulsion, but are used for steering in combination with the tail. The species is , maintaining its body temperature at about 32 °C (90 °F), lower than most mammals, even while foraging for hours in water below 5 °C (41 °F). Dives normally last around 30 seconds, but can last longer, although few exceed the estimated aerobic limit of 40 seconds. Recovery at the surface between dives commonly takes from 10 to 20 seconds. When not in the water, the platypus retires to a short, straight resting burrow of oval cross-section, nearly always in the riverbank not far above water level, and often under a protective tangle of roots. The average sleep time of a platypus is said to be as long as 14 hours per day, possibly because it eats , which provide a high level of calories. The platypus is a : it feeds on worms, , freshwater , and ( ) that it digs out of the riverbed with its snout or catches while swimming. It uses cheek-pouches to carry prey to the surface, where it is eaten. The platypus needs to eat about 20% of its own weight each day, which requires it to spend an average of 12 hours daily looking for food. When the platypus was first encountered by European , they were divided over whether the female lays eggs. This was finally confirmed by 's team in 1884. The species exhibits a single ; mating occurs between June and October, with some local variation taking place between different populations across its range. Historical observation, studies, and preliminary investigations of population genetics indicate the possibility of both resident and transient members of populations, and suggest a mating system. Females are thought likely to become sexually mature in their second year, with breeding confirmed still to take place in animals over nine years old. Outside the mating season, the platypus lives in a simple ground burrow, the entrance of which is about 30 cm (12 in) above the water level. After mating, the female constructs a deeper, more elaborate burrow up to 20 m (65 ft) long and blocked at intervals with plugs (which may act as a safeguard against rising waters or predators, or as a method of regulating humidity and temperature). The male takes no part in caring for his young, and retreats to his year-long burrow. The female softens the ground in the burrow with dead, folded, wet leaves, and she fills the nest at the end of the tunnel with fallen leaves and reeds for bedding material. This material is dragged to the nest by tucking it underneath her curled tail. The female platypus has a pair of , but only the left one is functional. The platypus's genes are a possible evolutionary link between the mammalian and bird/reptile sex-determination systems because one of the platypus's five X chromosomes contains the gene, which birds possess on their Z chromosome. It lays one to three (usually two) small, leathery eggs (similar to those of reptiles), about 11 mm ( 7⁄16 in) in diameter and slightly rounder than bird eggs. The eggs develop for about 28 days, with only about 10 days of external (in contrast to a chicken egg, which spends about one day in tract and 21 days externally). After laying her eggs, the female curls around them. The incubation period is divided into three phases. In the first phase, the has no functional organs and relies on the for sustenance. The yolk is absorbed by the developing young. During the second phase, the digits develop, and in the last phase, the appears. Most mammal zygotes go through cleavage, meaning that, following fertilization, the ovum is split due to cell divisions into multiple, divisible daughter cells. This is in comparison to the more ancestral process of cleavage, present in like the platypus and in non-mammals like . In meroblastic cleavage, the ovum does not split completely. This causes the cells at the edge of the yolk to be cytoplasmically continuous with the egg's cytoplasm. This allows the yolk, which contains the embryo, to exchange waste and nutrients with the cytoplasm. There is no official term for platypus young, but the term platypup sees unofficial use, as does puggle. Newly hatched platypuses are vulnerable, blind, and hairless, and are fed by the mother's milk. Although possessing , the platypus lacks teats. Instead, milk is released through pores in the skin. The milk pools in grooves on her abdomen, allowing the young to lap it up. After they hatch, the offspring are milk-fed for three to four months. During incubation and weaning, the mother initially leaves the burrow only for short periods, to forage. When doing so, she creates a number of thin soil plugs along the length of the burrow, possibly to protect the young from predators; pushing past these on her return forces water from her fur and allows the burrow to remain dry. After about five weeks, the mother begins to spend more time away from her young, and at around four months, the young emerge from the burrow. A platypus is born with teeth, but these drop out at a very early age, leaving the horny plates it uses to grind food. Platypus The platypus and other monotremes were very poorly understood, and some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them – for example, that the monotremes were inferior or – still endure. In 1947, theorised that placental mammals and marsupials may have diverged earlier, and a subsequent branching divided the monotremes and marsupials, but later research and fossil discoveries have suggested this is incorrect. In fact, modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree, and a later branching is thought to have led to the and placental groups. and fossil dating suggest platypuses split from around 19–48 million years ago. The oldest discovered fossil of the modern platypus dates back to about 100,000 years ago, during the period. The extinct monotremes and were once thought to be closely related to the modern platypus, but are now considered more basal taxa. The fossilised Steropodon was discovered in and is composed of an opalised lower jawbone with three molar teeth (whereas the adult contemporary platypus is toothless). The molar teeth were initially thought to be , which would have supported a variation of Gregory's theory, but later research has suggested, while they have three cusps, they evolved under a separate process. The fossil is thought to be about 110 million years old, making it the oldest mammal fossil found in Australia. Unlike the modern platypus (and ), Teinolophos lacked a beak. , another fossil relative of the platypus, has been found in , indicating monotremes were present in the supercontinent of when the continents of and Australia were joined via (until about 167 million years ago). A fossilised tooth of a giant platypus species, , was dated 5–15 million years ago. Judging by the tooth, the animal measured 1.3 metres long, making it the largest platypus on record. Because of the early divergence from the and the low numbers of extant monotreme species, the platypus is a frequent subject of research in evolutionary biology. In 2004, at the discovered the platypus has ten , compared with two (XY) in most other mammals. These ten chromosomes form five unique pairs of XY in males and XX in females, i.e. males are X 1 Y 1 X 2 Y 2 X 3 Y 3 X 4 Y 4 X 5 Y 5 . One of the X chromosomes of the platypus has great homology to the bird Z chromosome. The platypus genome also has both reptilian and mammalian genes associated with egg fertilisation. Though the platypus lacks the mammalian sex-determining gene , a study found that the mechanism of sex determination is the on the oldest . A draft version of the platypus genome sequence was published in on 8 May 2008, revealing both reptilian and mammalian elements, as well as two genes found previously only in birds, amphibians, and fish. More than 80% of the platypus's genes are common to the other mammals whose genomes have been sequenced. An updated genome, the most complete on record, was published in 2021, together with the genome of the . Except for its loss from the state of South Australia, the platypus occupies the same general distribution as it did prior to . However, local changes and fragmentation of distribution due to human modification of its habitat are documented. Its historical abundance is unknown and its current abundance difficult to gauge, but it is assumed to have declined in numbers, although as of 1998 was still being considered as common over most of its current range. The species was extensively hunted for its fur until the early years of the 20th century and, although protected throughout Australia since 1905, until about 1950 it was still at risk of drowning in the nets of inland . The recategorised its status as near threatened in 2016. The species is protected by law, but the only state in which it is listed as endangered is South Australia, under the . In 2020 it has been recommended to be listed as a vulnerable species in Victoria under the state's . The platypus is not considered to be in immediate danger of extinction, because conservation measures have been successful, but it could be adversely affected by habitat disruption caused by , , , netting, and trapping. Reduction of watercourse flows and water levels through excessive droughts and extraction of water for industrial, agricultural, and domestic supplies are also considered a threat. The lists the platypus on its as as assessed in 2016, when it was estimated that numbers had reduced by about 30 percent on average since European settlement. The animal is listed as endangered in South Australia, but it is not covered at all under the federal . Researchers have worried for years that declines have been greater than assumed. In January 2020, researchers from the presented evidence that the platypus is at risk of , due to a combination of extraction of , , and severe . The study predicted that, considering current threats, the animals' abundance would decline by 47%–66% and occupancy by 22%–32% over 50 years, causing extinction of local populations across about 40% of the range. Under projections of climate change projections to 2070, reduced habitat due to drought would lead to 51–73% reduced abundance and 36–56% reduced metapopulation occupancy within 50 years respectively. These predictions suggested that the species would fall under the Vulnerable classification. The authors stressed the need for national conservation efforts, which might include conducting more surveys, tracking trends, reduction of threats and improvement of river management to ensure healthy platypus habitat. Co-author Gilad Bino is concerned that the estimates of the 2016 baseline numbers could be wrong, and numbers may have been reduced by as much as half already. A November 2020 report by scientists from the , funded by a research grant from the in collaboration with the and the revealed that that platypus habitat in Australia had shrunk by 22 per cent in the previous 30 years, and recommended that the platypus should be listed as a threatened species under the EPBC Act . Declines in population had been greatest in NSW, in particular in the . Platypuses generally suffer from few in the wild; however, as of 2008 there was concern in Tasmania about the potential impacts of a disease caused by the fungus . The disease (termed ) affects only Tasmanian platypuses, and had not been observed in platypuses in mainland Australia. Affected platypuses can develop skin lesions or on various parts of their bodies, including their backs, tails, and legs. Mucormycosis can kill platypuses, death arising from secondary infection and by affecting the animals' ability to maintain body temperature and forage efficiently. The Biodiversity Conservation Branch at the Department of Primary Industries and Water collaborated with NRM north and researchers to determine the impacts of the disease on Tasmanian platypuses, as well as the mechanism of transmission and spread of the disease. Much of the world was introduced to the platypus in 1939 when published an article on the platypus and the efforts to study and raise it in captivity. The latter is a difficult task, and only a few young have been successfully raised since, notably at in . The leading figure in these efforts was , who established a platypusary (a simulated stream in a tank) at the Healesville Sanctuary, where breeding was successful in 1943. In 1972, he found a dead baby of about 50 days old, which had presumably been born in captivity, at his at on the , Queensland. Healesville repeated its success in 1998 and again in 2000 with a similar stream tank. Since 2008, platypus has bred regularly at Healesville, including second-generation (captive born themselves breeding in captivity). in bred twins in 2003, and breeding was again successful there in 2006. As of 2019, the only platypuses in captivity outside of Australia are in the in the of . Three attempts were made to bring the animals to the , in 1922, 1947, and 1958; of these, only two of the three animals introduced in 1947 lived longer than eighteen months. used to hunt platypuses for food (their fatty tails being particularly nutritious), while, after colonisation, Europeans hunted them for fur from the late 19th century and until 1912, when it was prohibited by law. In addition, European researchers captured and killed platypus or removed their eggs, partly in order to increase scientific knowledge, but also to gain prestige and outcompete rivals from different countries. The platypus has been a subject in the stories of , some of whom believed the animal was a hybrid of a duck and a . : 57–60 According to one story of the upper , the major animal groups, the land animals, water animals and birds, all competed for the platypus to join their respective groups, but the platypus ultimately decided to not join any of them, feeling that he did not need to be part of a group to be special, : 83–85 and wished to remain friends with all of those groups. Another Dreaming story emanate of the upper Darling tells of a young duck which ventured too far, ignoring the warnings of her tribe, and was kidnapped by a large water-rat called Biggoon. After managing to escape after some time, she returned and laid two eggs which hatched into strange furry creatures, so they were all banished and went to live in the mountains. The platypus is also used by some as a , which is to them a natural object, plant or animal that is inherited by members of a clan or family as their spiritual emblem, and the animal holds special meaning as a totem animal for the people, who live along the . Because of their cultural significance and importance in , the platypus is protected and conserved by these Indigenous peoples. The platypus has often been used as a symbol of Australia's . In the 1940s, live platypuses were given to allies in the , in order to strengthen ties and boost morale. Platypuses have been used several times as mascots: Syd the platypus was one of the three mascots chosen for the along with an echidna and a , Expo Oz the platypus was the mascot for , which was held in in 1988, and the platypus is the mascot for the operating system, the -based core of and other operating systems from Since the introduction of to in 1966, the embossed image of a platypus, designed and sculpted by , has appeared on the reverse (tails) side of the . The platypus has frequently appeared in Australian postage stamps, most recently the 2015 Native Animals series and the 2016 Australian Animals Monotremes series. In the American animated series (2007–2015), the own a pet bluish-green platypus named who, unknown to them, is a secret agent. Such choices were inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit the animal's striking appearance; additionally, show creator , who also wrote the character's theme song, said that its opening lyrics are based on the introductory sentence of the Platypus article on Wikipedia, copying the semiaquatic egg-laying mammal phrase word for word, and appending the phrase of action. As a character, Perry has been well received by both fans and critics. Coincidentally, real platypuses show a similar cyan color when seen under ultraviolet lighting. "

The platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom. The platypus has a paddle-shaped tail, like a ; a sleek, furry body, like an ; and a flat bill and webbed feet, like a duck. In fact, the first time a stuffed platypus was brought from Australia to Britain, people couldn't believe it was a real animal; they thought a trickster had sewn two animals together, according to London's (opens in new tab) . Platypuses (which is the correct plural form, not platypi) are among the few venomous mammals. Males have a spur, connected to a venom-secreting gland, on each hind foot. More venom is secreted during mating season, leading researchers to think that the spurs and venom help males compete for mates, according to the (opens in new tab) . The venom is not life-threatening to humans, but it can cause severe swelling and excruciating pain. Related: Adult male platypuses can range between about 15.7 inches to 24.8 inches (39.8 to 62.9 centimeters) long, from the tip of the bill to tip of the tail, according to the (opens in new tab) . Adult females range from 14.5 to 21.6 inches (36.8 to 54.8 cm) long. Adult males weigh about 1.7 to 6.6 lbs. (0.8 to 3 kilograms) and females weigh about 1.3 to 3.7 lbs. (0.6 to 1,7 kg). Scientists have found fossils that suggest that ancient platypuses were significantly larger than the modern variety, at about 3.3 feet (1 meter) long, . Platypuses have dense, thick fur that helps them stay warm underwater. Most of the fur is dark brown, except for a patch of lighter fur near each eye and lighter-colored fur on the underside. Under light, however, platypuses' drab brown fur glows green and blue, (opens in new tab) . It's possible that this biofluorescence helps reduce the animals' visibility to predators, but the eerie glow may serve little or no ecological function. Scientists are still investigating this question. A platypus's front feet have extra skin that acts like a paddle when the animal is swimming. When platypuses are on land, their webbing retracts, making the claws more pronounced, according to (opens in new tab) . The animals walk on their knuckles to protect the webbing, according to a 2001 report in the (opens in new tab) . The bill of a platypus resembles that of a duck and has a smooth texture that feels like suede. It is also flexible and rubbery. The skin of the bill holds tens of thousands of sensory receptors that help the platypus navigate underwater and detect movement of potential food, such as shrimp, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Male platypuses carry venom glands, located near their pelvises, that connect to hollow spurs on their hind legs, according to a (opens in new tab) a toxinologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia. Young females also have these spurs, but they lose them in the first year of life. The venom glands of adult males fluctuate in size throughout the year, reaching their maximum size during breeding season, when males use their venom to compete for mates. To inject its venom, a male wraps its legs around its victim and drives the spurs through the animal's flesh, according to op den Brouw. The venom itself contains a cocktail of more than a dozen proteins that belong to three major classes of toxins, op den Brouw wrote. This venom is not lethal to platypuses or humans, but it causes swelling and excruciating pain, and it can disrupt wound healing and the function of cell membranes, she noted. In humans, the pain from a platypus sting can be treated with nerve blockers, which block specific nerve cells from sending signals to the . Platypuses live in Australia in a range that extends from western Victoria to about as far north as Cooktown in Queensland, meaning they occupy a large stretch of the east and southeast coast of the country, according to the (opens in new tab) . The creatures can also be found on Tasmania and King Island, as well as on Kangaroo Island, where platypuses were introduced by humans in the early 1900s. Platypuses occupy freshwater systems — including river basins, lakes, ponds and streams — throughout their habitat range. The animals spend about 10 to 12 hours a night in the water, hunting for food; they are most active during nighttime and dusk, because they are nocturnal. They can stay underwater for only 30 to 140 seconds, the Australian Museum notes. During the day, they hide out in burrows on the shore, where earthen tunnels open up into oval-shaped underground chambers, according to the (opens in new tab) . Platypuses also take shelter under rock ledges, roots and debris, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Though they exist on only one side of one continent, platypuses weather many climatic extremes. They have been found in plateaus, lowlands, tropical rainforests, and the cold mountains of Tasmania and the Australian Alps. Platypuses' waterproof, thick fur keeps them warm in chilly weather, and their big tails store extra fat for energy, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Platypuses are carnivorous, which means they eat meat but not plants. They hunt for their food in the water where they live. As they swim, they detect food along the muddy bottom of the river, stream, pond or lake using only their sensitive bills, since the animals actually close their eyes, ears and nostrils while foraging underwater, according to the Australian Museum. When platypuses find something interesting, like insect larvae, they scoop it up in their bills, store it in their cheek pouches and swim to the surface. The animals also eat shrimp, swimming beetles, water bugs and tadpoles, as well as the occasional worm, freshwater pea mussel or snail. Platypuses have even been observed eating cicadas and moths that they catch at the water's surface, according to the Australian Museum. After coming up from a dive, platypuses float atop the water and chew their food using grinding plates in their mouths. The animals sometimes pick up mud and sand in their cheek pouches, and as they eat, they expel this inedible sediment, along with excess water, through grooves in their lower jaws, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Most mammals give birth to live young. Platypuses, however, lay eggs. Mammals that lay eggs are known as monotremes, and besides the platypus, the only other monotremes are , or spiny anteaters, according to the University of Melbourne. Echidnas are found only in Australia and New Guinea. When female platypuses are ready to have their young, they burrow inside the ground on the riverbank and seal themselves into tunnel rooms. Each female then lays one to three eggs and places them between her rump and her tail to keep them warm. After about 10 days, the eggs hatch and the bean-size babies nurse for three to four months inside their burrow, according to the Australian Museum. Around the time of weaning, baby platypuses can swim on their own, according to the Australian Platypus Conservatory. Here is the taxonomy of the platypus, according to the (opens in new tab) (ITIS): Platypuses are not endangered, but the (opens in new tab) (IUCN) lists them as near threatened, meaning the species may be vulnerable to extinction in the near future but does not currently qualify as threatened. The platypus was first listed as near threatened in 2016 after scientists observed a decline in the species' overall numbers, although the decline is poorly defined and inconsistent across the platypus's range, the Australian Platypus Conservatory notes on its website.

They are the one of the few mammals that reproduce by lay eggs, known as . Another name for platypus is the duck-billed platypus. When platypus was first discovered, its caused considerable confusion and uncertainty between European natural historians and scientists. Many thought that the creature was not real. Platypus is one of the distinctive animals in the animal domain. Its body is sleek and furry. It has a flat bill and a paddle-shaped tail. Besides, a platypus has webbed feet that contain toxic spurs, dense fur, and a sensitive, flexible bill. Other facts about platypuses are described in the following sections. The female platypus is smaller than the male platypus; the males can measure up to 60 cm long from the tip of the bill to the tip of the tail. Typically, females are 370 to 550 millimeters, and males are 400 to 630 millimeters long. The weight for females ranges from 600 to 1,700 grams, while the males weigh about 800 to 3,000 grams. The platypuses have heavy skeletons, which look like the ones for the reptiles; both the platypuses and reptiles’ skeletons have pectoral girdles and legs that are spread out. A young platypus has teeth which drop out in their first interaction with water. One adaptation that helps the platypuses stay warm in water is its dense, thick fur. Mostly, the fur is dark brown except for the patch of lighter-colored fur on the lower side, and lighter fur nearby each eye. When platypuses are swimming, their front feet help them since they have another skin that acts as a paddle. When they are on land, their claws are made more strong by the webbing retracts. The awkward walk of these animals on their knuckles keeps the webbing from harm. The billed platypuses are rubbery, flexible, and have a smooth touch that feels like suede. It has many receptors (held by the skin of their bill) that help the animal navigate when in the water and discover the movement of possible food such as the shrimp. Platypuses navigate with the tails and hind feet and swim with the front feet. Platypuses can move swim very well in the water as compared to when they are moving across the land. Notably, they use about 30% additional energy while moving on land than when swimming through the water. When they are disturbed, platypuses can make a relatively quiet growling sound. The animal can determine the direction of the electric source, explaining why they exhibit the side-by-side movement of their heads when looking for food. The platypuses sleep during the day, and they stay in the burrows when they are not looking for food. Platypuses can take as long as ten to twelve hours hunting for food. These animals are . Freshwater areas that run into and out the eastern and southern coast of Australia and island of Tasmania are homes to the platypuses. They toddle onto the watersides to dig burrows using their claws, mostly when they are on the water. The other habitats for platypuses include ledges, under rocks, debris, and roots. Even though platypuses mostly stay in the water, they cannot entirely stay underwater, but they only stay for 0.5 to 2.3 minutes inside the water. They have waterproof fur skin that shelters their eyes and ears. In addition, their noses stay shut when they in the water to enhance prevention of water from entering. The platypuses can survive in climate extremes even though they only live on one side of the continent. Platypuses have been found in tropical rainforests, lowlands, plateaus, and the cold mountains of Tasmania as well as the Australian high mountains. The tails of the platypuses store more fat for energy while the thick, waterproof fur keeps the platypuses warm in the cold climatic conditions. Platypuses are carnivorous; their food include insects and shellfish in water. Their sensitized bills help them discover food in the muddy bottom of the water as they swim. Platypuses have only grinding plates since they have no teeth and so when they find something for food, they scoop them up in their beaks then store in the cheek pouches and swim to the surface. They then use any pebbles or mud they scooped up alongside their prey/food at the bottom of the water to smash the food into digestive parts. Platypuses are one of the very few mammals that secrete venom. At the back of the males’ hind feet, there is a spur that is joined to the venom-secreting glands; platypus uses them against animals that prey on them or in battles with other males during breeding. According to the Australian Platypus Conservatory, the poison venom and the spurs are essential to the male platypuses while they ate striving to breed. The venom can cause severe swelling and intense pain but not life menacing to humans. The female platypus excavates down inside the ground on the waterside and covers herself into one of her tunnel rooms when it is time to breed. She will then lay eggs and put them between her tail and her rump to provide warmth. During this period, they use fats stored in the tails for food supply. The eggs, after around ten days, hatch and then babies begin to suckle for three to four months. Baby platypuses are capable of swimming on their own at the time they start looking for other food apart from their mother’s milk.

        "html_text": "The platypus is among nature's most unlikely animals. In fact, the first scientists to examine a specimen believed they were the victims of a hoax. The animal is best described as a hodgepodge of more familiar species: the duck (bill and webbed feet), beaver (tail), and otter (body and fur). Males are also venomous. They have sharp stingers on the heels of their rear feet and can use them to deliver a strong toxic blow to any foe. Platypuses hunt underwater, where they swim gracefully by paddling with their front webbed feet and steering with their hind feet and beaverlike tail. Folds of skin cover their eyes and ears to prevent water from entering, and the nostrils close with a watertight seal. In this posture, a platypus can remain submerged for a minute or two and employ its sensitive bill to find food. These Australian mammals are bottom feeders. They scoop up insects and larvae, shellfish, and worms in their bill along with bits of gravel and mud from the bottom. All this material is stored in cheek pouches and, at the surface, mashed for consumption. Platypuses do not have teeth, so the bits of gravel help them to “chew” their meal. On land, platypuses move a bit more awkwardly. However, the webbing on their feet retracts to expose individual nails and allow the creatures to run. Platypuses use their nails and feet to construct dirt burrows at the water's edge. Platypus reproduction is nearly unique. It is one of only two mammals (the echidna is the other) that lay eggs. Females seal themselves inside one of the burrow's chambers to lay their eggs. A mother typically produces one or two eggs and keeps them warm by holding them between her body and her tail. The eggs hatch in about ten days, but platypus infants are the size of lima beans and totally helpless. Females nurse their young for three to four months until the babies can swim on their own.

        "html_text": "The platypus is as fascinating on the inside as it is on the outside! Among Australia’s most iconic wildlife, this semi-aquatic, egg-laying species is also one of the few venomous mammals. At a glance, it looks like a hodgepodge of animal pieces stitched together: a paddle-shaped tail from an otter, a sleek body covered in dense, chestnut-colored fur like a mole, a wide, flat duck-like bill attached in front of its little round eyes, and big webbed feet like a pelican. All these characteristics come in handy for its freshwater lifestyle—that bizarre looking bill is laden with thousands of receptors that help a platypusl navigate the murky depths and detect tiny movements of potential food like shellfish or insects. Just “fur” fun. While their range is just one small area of the world, they weather many climate extremes (and fresh water sources) from toasty plateaus and rainforests, to the chilly mountainous regions of Tasmania and the Australian Alps. Their dense fur makes fine insulation, both in the water and out. Platypus fur is waterproof and traps an insulating layer of air to keep its body temperature stable, even in cold water. Long guard hairs protect the dense fur underneath, which stays dry even after a platypus has been in the water for hours. Mostly brown on its body, there’s a flash of white fur beneath its eyes, and its belly is lighter in color, too. Those big webbed feet help propel them through the water, and the claws make digging burrows a breeze. While lumbering somewhat awkwardly on land to protect the webbing on its feet, they are sleek missiles in the water. Its plump tail serves as a stabilizer during swimming and stores extra fat for energy. Its rear feet serve as rudders and brakes. Ready for the bill. Its signature “duck bill” is actually soft and pliable, not hard like a duck’s bill at all. It is dark colored, nearly black in contrast to its chocolate-colored coat. This strange-looking snout is laden with “pushrods” that respond to stimuli like touch, pressure, sound waves, and motion. Additionally, about 40,000 electroreceptors help them find the direction and distance of prey (its eyes and ears are closed while it’s underwater) by detecting electrical impulses generated by living creatures. Moving its head back and forth, it can find prey nearby and swiftly move in for the kill. Platypuses stow their prey in cheek pouches, and swim to the surface to eat. They (and their relatives the echidnas) don’t have teeth, but instead grind their food between mouth pads made of keratin. These pads are replaced continuously throughout its lifetime. Interestingly, freshly hatched platypuses have molar-like “milk teeth, but these are shed around the time they leave the nesting burrow. More wow. Of course, its major claim to fame is being an egg-laying mammal, or monotreme. While most other mammals have so-called live young, platypuses (along with echidnas) lay eggs, incubate them, and nurse their young. Wow! Other interesting characteristics include extra bones in the shoulder girdle, which is absent in other mammals. On land, the platypus has a reptilian gait because its legs are on the sides of the body, rather than underneath. The white spots on the fur under its eyes make it look like its eyes are open underwater, but they’re not. There is considerable variation in size among platypus populations. Generally, body size increases with latitude. So “Down Under” platypuses are smaller in northern regions, and larger in southern regions. For instance, a large male platypus in Tasmania can weigh three times as much as an average male in a northern population. Overall, males are larger than females and can measure 16 percent longer and 40 percent heavier than them. Wet and wonderful. According to the platypusspot.org website, ideal habitat for these monotremes “includes permanent water, stable earthen banks consolidated by the roots of native riparian vegetation that is also overhanging the water, and an abundant supply of macroinvertebrates.” Needless to say, natural changes like prolonged drought or human-made alterations like dams, tree clearing, and development, all impact the platypuses’ necessary habitat. Humans competing for fresh water poses even more threats to the platypus. Platypuses may also be found in shallow lakes, artificial water sources like water storage lakes, weir pools, ponds, and farm dams. They occasionally dip into brackish areas of estuaries, but mostly stick with freshwater areas. Adult male platypuses have larger home ranges than females—as long as 9.3 miles (15 kilometers)! A male may travel over 6 miles (10 kilometers) in a single night’s jaunt. Females tend to hunt closer to home, and her turf is usually less than 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers) long. Detecting dinner. While they may make repeated short dives of 30 to 60 seconds or so, they can stay underwater for up to 2 minutes. Dive time and depth is reliant on air in its lungs—they usually dive less than 16 feet (5 meters), though they occasionally take deeper dives to about 26 feet (8 meters). They come to the surface to recover for 10 to 20 seconds between dives. These underwater forays enable it to feed on insect larvae, freshwater shrimp, freshwater crayfish called yabbies (which it nuzzles out of the riverbed with its snout or catches while swimming), and worms. It uses cheek pouches to stow its bounty until it reaches the surface, where it can eat. Each day, a platypus needs to eat about 20 percent of its body weight, which requires about 12 hours of looking for food. Lacking teeth, the platypus must scoop up bits of gravel with its food to help “chew” its meal. They swallow soft parts of their prey and spit out the chitinous exoskeletons (like the shells of crayfish and insects). Due to its somewhat limited ability to hold its breath, the platypus forages in more shallow lakes and bodies of water, between 3 and 16 feet (1 and 5 meters) deep. Nice digs. Male and female platypuses dig simple burrows along rivers and streams outside the breeding season. They can also make their home under rock ledges, roots, and debris, where they rest throughout the day. However, pregnant females dig a deeper, more elaborate nesting burrow, with multiple chambers and entrances, called a nursery burrow. When the female leaves her young behind to forage, she makes a soft covering of soil and debris to plug the opening. Resting burrows are used by males and nonbreeding females. Runs cool. The average body temperature of a platypus is about 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), while most placental mammals run about 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). It is able to maintain this temperature even when foraging for hours in water below 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius). Brrrr! Nocturnal journal. The platypus is generally active at night and dusk, and occasionally active by day. It emerges from its burrow in late afternoon to forage for food. By early morning, it is ready to re-enter the burrow. One scientist found that platypuses in the southeastern Australian state of Victoria spent 11 to 17 hours holed up in the burrow. Others have found that platypuses can hunt for 10 to 12 hours at a time. Its high-calorie diet of crustaceans enables the platypus to sleep soundly for up to 14 hours a day! Interesting side note: the platypus spends nearly 60 percent of its daily sleep in deep, brain-active REM sleep (in contrast, humans spend about 25 percent of their slumber in that rich, REM state). Pregnant females spend time building a cozy nest, nursing and nurturing their young, and foraging for food. While platypuses are not considered hibernators, they may be inactive for extended periods of time. Watch out! For the platypus, leaving its burrow is a high-risk proposition, even at night. When drought or altering of waterways occurs, platypuses are forced to travel on land, making them more vulnerable to predation. Aerial predators like owls, eagles, and hawks may prey upon them. Native threats like dingoes, Tasmanian devils, monitor lizards, snakes, and water rats also await. Invasive feral and unleashed dogs, cats, and foxes also take them. Low platypus numbers in northern Australia may be due to heavy predation by crocodiles. Male platypuses have spurs on the rear ankles, connected to a venom gland located over its thighs. If the spur pierces the skin, it can release enough venom to kill a medium-sized dog. (It is not fatal to humans, but is excruciating, and causes swelling.) The venom is more plentiful during breeding season, leading scientists to believe that it is used to defend mates and resources from rival males. As air-breathing, aquatic mammals, platypuses can quickly drown after getting entangled in discarded litter, fishing line, and mesh netting. “Opera house” nets that people set to catch crayfish and yabbies can be death traps for platypuses, turtles, and water rats, as wildlife cannot escape. These underwater traps (roughly shaped like the Sydney Opera House, hence the name) are often set during summer months, when female platypuses may be pregnant, which exacerbates the impact on fragmented populations. Even common items like rubber bands, plastic rings, or hair ties can be lethal when caught on the legs or neck of a swimming platypus. Say what? The platypus is largely solitary, so a vast vocal repertoire is not necessary. It emits a growl when disturbed, and a range of other vocalizations have been noted. Scent glands on both sides of the neck produce a musky scent during the breeding season. They rub against logs and rocks near the water to mark objects. When swimming, the platypus will make a big splash when alarmed as it slips beneath the surface, likely to give other platypuses a heads up. Usually, they are nearly silent when diving. You’re a good egg. Males compete for breeding opportunities (hence the venomous spur), while females typically mate with a single male. Once she has settled on a male, aquatic courtship ensues, with the pair diving and swimming past each other, then grasping and rolling together. Pregnant platypuses seek shelter in a burrow chamber dug into a riverbank to lay 1 to 3 eggs. (The four echidna species are the only other living egg-laying mammals, which are called monotremes.) This elaborate burrow is much deeper and blocked at intervals with plugs, which may protect her eggs from predators or rising waters, or regulate humidity and temperature in the burrow. She lines this nesting chamber with wet leaves, twigs, and vegetation, which she carries into her burrow between her hind feet and her tail. Safely sealed inside, she keeps her eggs between her rump and her tail to keep them warm, only leaving the burrow to defecate and wet her fur. Typically, her eggs are about 0.7 inches (1.7 centimeters) in a diameter and rounder than bird eggs. The shell is soft and pliant. After about 10 days, the hairless, bean-sized babies hatch and begin to suckle for the next 3 or 4 months. The mother does not have nipples, but rather special patches of skin on the abdomen that exude milk for her babies to slurp up. By the time they are weaned and leave the nest, the baby platypuses have fur and can swim on their own. The San Diego Zoo Safari Park is currently the only zoo outside Australia to house platypuses. When two platypuses—a male named Birrarung and a female named Eve—arrived in San Diego in October 2019, it was the first time in more than 50 years that platypuses were cared for outside of Australia. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance recognizes that we are only the most recent stewards of wildlife that means a great deal to Australians, and holds cultural significance for the Aboriginal Nations of Australia. The two platypuses were flown to San Diego from their home at Australia's Taronga Zoo Sydney to serve as ambassadors outside their native Australia, to help communicate the importance of fresh water for both humans and wildlife. Freshwater resources and habitats are being affected by pollution and climate change. People are encouraged to be part of the solution and protect wildlife through water conservation measures and practices that help slow climate change. Guests can now see the platypus pair in Walkabout Australia's new Nelson A. Millsberg Platypus Habitat, which includes three pools, naturalistic river banks, extensive tunnels, and nesting areas. The platypuses quickly acclimated to their new home, exploring every inch of their surroundings, playing in the waterfalls and hunting for crayfish. Because platypuses are most active during dusk and nighttime hours, the lighting cycle in their habitat has been reversed to mimic evening light during the day and daylight at night. Fresh water is a precious resource. As development and growing human populations disrupt these aquatic ecosystems, it can impact platypus populations. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance is proud to support a cutting-edge conservation effort in southeastern Australia that benefits endemic wildlife, including the platypus. A collaborative team is using a new technology called environmental DNA (eDNA) to map the distribution of and threats to five kinds of fish and the platypus. The goal is to secure populations in at least three natural catchment areas. As living things shed their DNA through skin, hair, scales, feces, and eggs, water samples collected and filtered through a special unit that strains out cells and analyzes them will reveal the wildlife that are present. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance is pleased to be supporting the “boots on the ground” efforts to preserve endemic wildlife, including the platypus. By supporting San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, you are our ally in saving and protecting wildlife around the globe. Length from tip of bill to tip of tail: males 16 to 25 inches (40 to 63 centimeters); females 15 to 22 inches (37 to 55 centimeters) Weight: males: 1.8 to 6.6 pounds (0.8 to 3 kilograms); females: 1.3 to 3.7 pounds (0.6 to 1.7 kilograms) Length at hatch: about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) Life span: 7 to 14 years; or up to 21 years in zoos Gestation: approximately 21 days Incubation: approximately 10 days Number of young at hatch: 1 to 3 eggs per breeding season; usually 2 eggs Age of weaning: 3 to 4 months old The word “platypus” is derived from a Greek word meaning “flat foot.” The correct plural ending is “es”—making “platypuses” preferred over “platypi.” The platypus and the echidna are the only living mammals that lay eggs. They are called monotremes. Females don’t nurse their young with nipples, rather they exude milk through skin patches. Adult male platypuses have venomous spurs, an unusual characteristic among mammals, used to defend mates and territory from rival males. Females have two ovaries, but only the left one is functional, similar to many birds and some reptiles. "

It’s perfect served with tortilla chips or as a topping over your favorite Mexican food, like tacos, burritos, taquitos and so forth. The best party food around and a must-have snack! Fact: the best salsa is made with fresh tomatoes. Okay, that’s just my opinion, but in the past I thought I could go the route of using all canned tomatoes, but using fresh tomatoes makes a world of difference! Fresh tomatoes make the best salsa, especially when you use nicely ripened in season tomatoes. This is hands down my favorite salsa recipe, and I don’t know that I’ll ever need another one. It just has the perfect ratio and blend of everything. It’s not too oniony or garlicy, nor too spicy for my kids, it doesn’t tasting like it came from a can and it has the perfect brightness with the fresh lime. Then it has a classic Mexican flavor with the cilantro and hint of chili powder and cumin. The sugar I’d say is only needed if you are using store-bought tomatoes. If you grow your own or buy them at the farmers market, the quality is a bit better and they’re a bit sweeter so the sugar isn’t needed. Making salsa at home couldn’t be easier! Here’s how you’ll make it: What to go all out? Try this with homemade tortilla chips, or . Everyone will be totally impressed! I don’t make them often, but when I do it makes the fresh salsa that much better. This salsa should last for up to a week if stored in a sealed container in the fridge. I love this salsa with canned plain tomatoes, canned tomatoes with green chilies, or canned fire roasted tomatoes. All work great, just use what you have.

I have a lot of fresh tomatoes and garlic and would like to know if I add vinegar to this recipe, would it last longer in the fridge? I’m wanting to make salsa for an event that is two weeks away! I don’t think that will extend the shelf life by much and the vinegar will overpower the flavors I think. Best salsa I’ve ever tasted! My family agrees. Thank you for another great recipe. My son, who is a big salsa lover (but hates veggies—go figure lol) wasn’t a fan of this recipe. Maybe I pulsed it too much because it looked more like corse baby food How many cups does this recipe make? I need 5 cups of fresh salsa for a recipe (for 20 ppl) Best salsa I have ever had it’s awesome thanks! Need more heat add another jalapeño with seeds. Amazing recipe and I will never buy salsa again!

There is a tomato overload in my backyard right now. Every year I plant way more tomato seeds than any one family should, in hopes that a few plants will survive and thrive. I am not known for being the best gardener, yet I do get lucky every now and again. This year, my tomato plants took off, providing us with a seemingly endless supply of seven varieties of tomatoes. I have been eating them in salads and sauces for the last month. Yet I always say, when life gives you tomatoes… Make salsa! There are hundreds thousands of tomato-based salsa recipes online. Why should you make this one? Well, we think this is The Best Homemade Salsa Recipe around because it is healthy, quick to make, offers a fine chunky texture, and is brimming with absurd amounts of flavor. Want to know the secret to perfectly delicious salsa? Sometimes salsa made with just fresh ingredients can come off with a shallow flavor… Lacking depth. Whereas, salsa made with canned ingredients alone can taste store-bought. It is my belief that you need both fresh and canned ingredients to make the best homemade salsa recipe. Here is everything you need to make the most delicious salsa easily at home: You will taste bright tangy notes from garden-fresh tomatoes, sharp notes from the onion and garlic, herbs and spice, and complexity from the “secret ingredient” canned items, all in one ! Spoon this flavorful salsa over eggs, on your favorite Mexican dishes, or just scoop it up with chips or fresh veggies. You are going to love this recipe for game day, potlucks, parties, or just keeping it in the fridge for any time you need a zesty snack! Yes, this recipe has got zing but, if you are sensitive to spicy heat, you can adjust The Best Homemade Salsa Recipe by adding fewer jalapeños and being sure to purchase the mild canned green chiles. Or if you prefer to take the heat up a notch, try throwing in habanero or serrano chiles! This salsa will keep well for 10-12 days if kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Be sure to not allow it to sit for too long (over an hour or so) at room temperature between keeping chilled in the fridge. You can also freeze this homemade salsa for up to 4 months by putting it in a and then wrapping it with foil. Making this recipe? Follow us on Instagram and tag so we can share what you’re cooking!

By commenting I offer my full consent to the of A Spicy Perspective. Δ I have been making this recipe for several years and it earns a 5 star rating.. It’s very good and balanced with the addition of fresh and canned tomatoes as well as the fresh onion, cilantro, garlic and lime. The Cumin, jalapenos, green chili’s are subbject to your own taste. Recipes are merely a corner stone and jumping off point. Always add less then build upon that according to your taste/ liking, also herbs and spices take time to develope (give them an hour or so). Again this is a GREAT base recipe…tweak it to your discretion. Thank you Sommer……. By far the best one I’ve tried. Adjusted the seasonings to my preference. Added chili powder, cayenne, no sugar. And way more cilantro. I use this as my start and then add what I want. Never disappointed, nor do I have any leftovers when I make it. This was my first attempt at making homemade salsa and I was not disappointed! I left out the sugar and ended up adding about 3/4 teaspoon more salt because I prefer salty rather than sweet salsa. I think I added about 2 teaspoons cumin. I am pretty sensitive to heat so I only used one jalapeño with the seeds removed, but it’s extremely mild so I think next time I’ll either do two jalapeños or I’ll add in most of the seeds to give it a slight kick. Will definitely make this again! I made this yesterday and it was good, but today it’s AMAZING!! Definitely let all the flavors come together overnight!! Sooooo good!!! Pingback: This is a super easy and delicious salsa recipe. I brought it to a party with some friends when we were making tamales. Everyone loved it! I can’t believe how good it comes out. The grocery store was out of jalapeños, so I even used canned, and it still turned out good. This is my new salsa go to recipe. YUM! Pingback: Pingback: Really good salsa! nice and fresh!easy to make. I put everything in the food processor and it was done in a couple of minutes.

Everyone who has tried it (I made a double batch haha) is obsessed! I don’t think I’ll ever buy salsa again – this is too yummy and sooo easy There was to much cumin for me. I think I will experiment with a combination of chilies. Caution this makes a large batch of salsa. Pingback: Pingback: Pingback: Pingback: Pingback: i agree- may be a bit too much onion- will taste after we let the salsa flavors meld before making a judgement on that tho! Very good! First homemade salsa I have made. I added some red jalapenos in addition to regular green ones. I couldn’t find the specific crushed tomatoes so I just used diced. My only problem is that it’s a little bit bitter, but I don’t follow quantities very well and wing it a little bit so just gives me the opportunity to play around more next time to get an even better flavor. Pingback: Pingback: So delicious husband loved so will be making again! I grow all the ingredients for this salsa. The recipe is outstanding. From July to October, I’m in heaven. Making batch after batch until harvest is done. Then anxiously wait until next season for this salsa. Actually 10 stars!!! Pingback: I added some tomato paste 1 tsp at a time to give salsa a redder color My neighbor just dropped off a box of fresh garden tomatoes and jalapeños so I knew salsa was in order. This is so delicious!! Perfect amount of kick. The cumin comes through which I love but I may cut back on it next time since it’s such a dominant flavor. Pingback: I like that this recipe uses fresh ripe tomatoes and canned san marzano tomatoes which by the way are amazing. I’ll have to try to make it and have a taste.

Have you ever tried to can it in hot water bath to keep longer? Pingback: Easy to make and better than most Mexican restaurants serve. Pingback: I made this recipe the other evening when I was serving tacos to company. I used diced tomatoes because crushed tomatoes aren’t available where I live. I also couldn’t find jalapenos. I bought another kind of small green chili, but didn’t end up putting it in. I thought the recipe had enough heat with the can of diced green chilis. This makes a large recipe. I froze the leftovers in several snack size sealable storage bags. I would definitely make this again. I live in the city, so I used the sweetest type of cherry tomato (cut in half) I can buy (22 oz). Pingback: Pingback: We leave out the green chiles and canned tomatoes and love the freshness of this salsa. It is perfect! Wow, this is a great recipe and it’s so delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe. My husband kept eating and eating this salsa, saying things like, “Yum! This is so good!,” and “I’m making a meal out of this!” and “It’s like catnip for humans!” He thoroughly enjoyed this recipe (which doesn’t happen very often when I make something, so thanks!). 😉 Hi Niki, LOL! Thanks for sharing – that just made my day. I’m so glad he liked it. :) I have always loved salsa as a game time or really anytime snack, I have tried various recipes and this one by far is the best, I’m actually surprised someone hasn’t put there own spin on this and started selling commercially! Easy and absolutely delicious. Our tomatoes have been over producing all summer and I have been struggling to find ways to use them. Wish I would have seen this a month ago, I made a test batch yesterday. We tried it. We loved it. So today I made 3 more to freeze Used tomatoes, hungarian wax peppers and Serrano peppers from our garden, stevia to keep it sugar free. Absolutely delicious! Simply delicious outcome and my first home made salsa. The 3 fresh jalapenos from the store’s local produce section were pretty mild….so mild that the seeds had no heat (!!)…so to increase the heat, I followed the recipe and then added another half of a 4.5 oz can of LaVictoria HOT diced Jalapeños which worked nicely.. Two large tomatoes, 4 roma tomatoes and the 15 oz of canned San Marzano tomatoes. Also used 1.5 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of sea salt, 2 tsp of cumin. I might decrease the sugar to 1 tsp or omit it all together next batch….and oh yes, I foresee a next batch. My wife and I are very impressed with our first salsa!! I bet it’s better tomorrow after chilling in the fridge overnight and melding. Thanks for the recipe! Don’t usually rate recipes, but this one is really good-a perfect mix of flavors. Pingback: Pingback: What would you have to afford to can this safely? What type and amount of “4 tomatoes”? I just finished making this recipe. I really like it, it was easy and very full of flavor. It makes a lot. In the fridge now so that the flavors will develop even more. You can make it such that it has a nice kick. I used serrano peppers. Pingback: Will this recipe can well? Hi Melissa, I have heard from some readers that they can this recipe. I have not personally tried it myself. If you give it a go, please report back! :) This truly is the best salsa ever! I have made it about 4 times now and will never go back to store bought. The only thing I did differently was I used Fire Roasted canned tomatoes. Also I grew some peppers called Hot Salsa so I used those. It is being hoovered up by everyone that tries it. Love it! This is fantastic. I would’ve thought that canned tomatoes are heresy, but they work incredibly well in this recipe. Cumin and canned tomatoes really pull this recipe together in a way I couldn’t match with just fresh tomatoes! I made it twice. Once with the canned tomatoes and once without using 6 large fresh tomatoes. I wasn’t crazy about the canned tomatoes version. It was tasty and good but I preferred the fresh version. Best salsa ever! I make a batch for my family every week, and it goes fast! Saves a lot of money over store-bought salsas too that don’t taste nearly as good as this fresh salasa does. Hard to find the San Marzano tomatoes in a 15 oz can, so I buy the bigger 30 oz can and refrigerate half for next time (which is not long). You have made us Salsa Junkies with this and we are so happy. Thanks! Looking forward to trying your other recipes! My tomato plants have done well this year and needed to use up A LOT of ripe ones. This tasted amazing, I would never have thought to add the canned ingredients to boost the flavor but it sure worked. Yum! Pingback: This is a must to try!!!!! Delicious, serving to my company today Made it a couple of times. It is a 5 star recipe for a reason. Easily adaptable if you like it hotter. I add a little extra salt, an extra jalepeno (or 2), a serrano…. I also like to chop up a little extra onion and tomatoe and just put it in after it is all done, to make it a little chunkier. (I only have a blender and it tends to really blend it even on the puree setting). Also as for the tomatoes I can only find whole peeled san marzano… So I just used a potatoe masher and mashed them up a bit. Will be my go to recipe. Holds up well, and taste amazing after 2-3 days. (That’s all it seems to last!) Thanks for the easy recipe! Loved this recipe. Instead of the 4.5oz of crushed tomatoes/green chilies I used 4oz of canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Added a wonderful smoky flavor to the salsa!! Thank you for the recipe. YESSSSS!! This was really good but I didn’t love the cumin. Next time I’ll leave that out, or lessen it significantly. I also added some tomatillos. I have made this numerous times and the tortilla holding grows each time!!! Fantastic Pingback: This was great salsa! Thank you! Very easy to make and the flavor is outstanding. Awesome recipe and will definitely make this a lot more now. This is my go to recipe for Salsa! Have made it for a few years now and the kids can hardly wait for our tomato harvest so they can devour salsa. My SIL bragged about her salsa recipe but after eating this one she has flipped! Don’t hesitate to make .. so easy and tasty. This salsa is amazing! But I don’t know where the 15oz can of crushed marzanos comes from though, I’ve never seen it, only 14.5oz. My daughter and I have been working on perfecting this recipe for our tastes… use less cilantro and ground cilantro, no sugar, and MSG. Comes out amazing! Great recipe, delicious salsa! I got a couple bags of fresh roasted chiles from the farmers market this morning and used them in the salsa, so good! I just made the salsa, and OMG! Sooo good!! I did everything as directed, and this is now my new favorite salsa! Thank you for this wonderful recipe! 😁 Love this Homemade Salsa Recipe, seems super amazing and delicious . Super excited to try this one, will love try this unique Salsa Recipe. It really is the best salsa!!! I never follow any recipe exactly, because I measure with my heart. I definitely like mine spicier I use 3 jalapenos and a serrano or two depending how spicy they are. I love these Fresh Tomatoes and Salsa. I have applied the recipe of this article to cook for everyone to eat. My family and I have been using this recipe for over a year now and it’s the best homemade salsa recipe because it tastes delicious, guarantees that your guests will love it and is so easy to make. Pingback: Pingback: Love this delicious homemade salsa recipe, this one seems super delicious and amazing . Will love to try this delicious and unique recipe . Thanks for sharing this recipe with us Thanks for sharing this best homemade salsa recipe, will love to try this super delicious homemade salsa recipe. Amazing one , thanks for sharing this one with us . Love this recipe. I use 4 fresh lunch box peppers instead of the green chillis. Also some smoked paprika to taste gives it a smokey flavor. Pingback: Pingback: Thank you for sharing with us such a yummy homemade salsa recipe, we will definitely try this recipe. Outstanding! This will be my go to salsa from now on!! Wow! This really is the best homemade salsa recipe! I’ve tried several different recipes but they never had the flavor I was looking for. This recipe nails it. Great flavor and texture. Very fresh tasting. I followed everything as written. It came out perfect. And it’s so easy. I won’t have to buy store bought salsa again. Thanks for sharing! Thanks for sharing this the best homemade salsa recipe, this one salsa recipe seems so delicious , will love to make this one . Yummy! Easy recipe I used my blender and it turned out great. Super inexpensive to make and it makes a good amount. Will add more spice to the next round to try. No more store bought salsa for us :) Yummy recipe i like cooking 😋 Love this salsa recipe. I’ll definitely be making it again very soon It is my favorite salsa recipe now and the only one I use. Very straightforward and simple, I’ve been looking for salsa recipes This is fantastic!! The only thing I need to change is less cumin. I put 2 tsp, and it was entirely too much. Next time I would like to try with just half a tsp cumin. Also, my family likes heat in their salsa, but as I’ve grown older my mouth has become really sensitive and I can’t eat anything super hot or I will have mouth ulcers. So, I used the 3 jalapenos but I left the seeds in one. Worked very well. It brought the heat just perfectly. Would love to know if I can can this. This was very easy to follow and turned out perfectly. Reminded me of the medium spice salso from Poquito Mas!. I substituted lemon for lime (it’s what I had in the house). Easy to halve so that you aren’t sitting with too much. My salsa has a very very intense onion taste. is there anything i can do to fix that? Try using a sweet white onion instead and maybe just 1/2 an onion. This salsa is so yummy! Does anyone know a way to Can it so it still tastes the same? Pingback: Hello, I’m jackson, I’m a chef who loves food, I’m always interested in new foods.Homemade Salsa Recipe is great! i just finished them tonight, taste is great and i had a great dinner with my little family. Thanks for your sharing. Sincerely grateful! Always fan of home made food . This salsa recipe looks so delicious , will definitely gonna try this one i want try las night with my family and taste is delicious very good. Pingback: This is great! I love this recipe and I will make mine special spicy. Thank you for this I used a combination of hot peppers, because my best friend grows them, had easy access, so I gauged for heat myself: jalapeno, cayenne, serrano, fresno. I certainly thank you for writing this article well, hopefully it will become a reference in journals or other scientific writings and can help many people. thanks. Of course, from the writing you write, there are things that still need to be explained in detail in order to be able to provide enlightenment and become a reference source for all who read. So basically “salsa” is raw meshed gravy of tomatoes , onions and other stuff . This is actually common in Indian food . Btw thanks for sharing recipe with us I can only find whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes.. how would I be able to incorporate these as a substitute? I made this recipe with regular crushed tomatoes, and want to bring it up to the next level. It was delicious, best I’ve had since my sister passed away. I think she was using your recipe. Closest I’ve gotten to re-creating hers. ❤️ I love salsa and i always thought how to make it since childhood but, after days past i forget that now through your post i will be able to make it now, thanks. This is a beautiful, dependable recipe. I made the recipe x 10, as I enjoy using my tomato harvest this way rather than simply canning plain tomatoes. I used a combination of hot peppers, because my best friend grows them, had easy access, so I gauged for heat myself: jalapeno, cayenne, serrano, fresno. My question is: I plan to CAN this today in a very large quantity to preserve at room temperature, so will cooking the ingredients together break down the consistency to mush? Sandra, Did you end up canning this recipe? We are trying to do the same and wondering how it will come out. Thanks! No; I just posted a few hours ago and am awaiting her reply. I canned salsa last year, and it was quite fine. But, I would certainly expect less chunkiness and more liquid from the cooking. But, this is the only way for me. I need to store at room temperature and not in the freezer. Also, I have soooo many fresh San Marzanos that I do not buy the canned at the store to add. I’m sure it has a better consistency, though, if I had. I made this recipe and love it, also wondering how to can it. Did you try? Did you add any canning salts or anything, or did you just can it as is? It’s a good starting point for a salsa but nothing special. If you’re not a fan of cumin, add in little by little. 2 tsp was too much for me. I ended up adding more peppers and a white onion in hopes to mask the strong cumin taste. I wouldn’t make this again. Best Salsa ever my family loved it thanks 🙏 Made this exactly as indicated (but all fresh tomatoes) and was amazing. So, Midwest gal thinks she is pretty spicy yet hasn’t learned her peppers yet. Store sold out of canned green Chili’s so improvised with one habenaro and one pablano roasted. Well, broke in to a sweat that even burned my eyes!!! Lol, not exaggerating! Whew! So dumped more cilantro and lime juice in, a little bit more stevia and a big pinch of Hungarian paprika. Toned it down to my level and still turned out super fresh and tasty…yum… I don’t think you can do wrong by this fool-proof recipe: thank you!!!!! How large are the tomatos you use? The ones from my garden are about Roma sized so I’m trying to determine how many to use. Thanks. Hi Amy, Yes, roma and plum tomatoes are perfect for this recipe! This looks delish!!! What do you do with the seeds in both fresh and canned tomatoes? cut out the core (the light green inside of the tomato) and the canned tomatoes just drain and put all contents in your processor. This recipe is awesome. I use it as a baseline but add to it with different types of ingredients and it delivers every time! what do you add? I am not sure if this recipe is exactly how I want it, but also not sure what to add XD Just getting ideas :) Great recipe Hey this is so tasty. Can I can it? Thanks! Most excellent! Not too spicy, and I loved the inclusion of cumin. I never considered using both canned and fresh tomatoes, but it worked. I would like a bit more garlic, but this is an easy adjustment. This is a great salsa recipe that turned out really tasty! My daughter loved it Made exactly as written. Fan flippin tastic!!!! Love it!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 OMG 😁 I love this recipe ❤❤❤ thanks Great tasting and easy to make. I like spicy more than the rest of my family but this had the right flavor keep us all happy I used 2 teaspoons cumin but 5 garlic cloves and certainly more than 1/3 cup cilantro. Will definitely make this again. Cookware set can help here better I made this for a recent summer gathering and it was a huge hit! Thanks so much for sharing. Authentic San Marzano tomatoes are not sold crushed. Whole or filet peeled are the only options. Crushed are available. You can google it. Crushed San Marzano are a fake product. You can google THAT! How do I know if my San Marzano tomatoes are real? So, if you spot a can of diced San Marzano tomatoes, you’re looking at a fake. Also, some brands even flat-out say the’re not from Italy in the label’s fine print. The real deal will also have the DOP seal and a Consorzio San Marzano certification number on the bottom of the can. Awesome salsa! Perfect. Quite tasty I used 2 jalapeños and ten ounces of green chili. I’m added a dash or three of ground ancho chili pepper. I was taught to simmer my salsa growing up in Central Texas. It helps the spices marry. Salsa is always better the 2nd day! Pingback: Pingback: We tried to make this for my family, and my family really love it. I will introduce your recipe for my friends. Thank you so much. I love it This was delicious and so easy! Not going to buy jar salsa anymore. The only thing that I do differently is I roast my whole tomatoes, pealed whole cloves of garlic and slice my onions into thick slices under the broiler till slightly browned and blackened then add to everything else in blender and pulse until desired thickness this is a great base recipe yummy I did not try salsa yet but by reading this easy recipe I am thinking to have of try to make such a delicious salsa. We enjoyed it but it was VERY cumin-y! I will reduce cumin next time we make it and add more lime. Pingback: Amazing – thanks for sharing! Pingback: This recipe was mouth watering delicious 😋. The only change I made was replacing the sugar with maple syrup. Definitely be making this again ❤❤❤❤ The best salsa ever!! If I cook this down can I then can? Water bath 15 min? Yes Diana! Low simmer salsa for 10 minutes and water bath 15! I’ll be canning this salsa later today! it was so yummmmm Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe. It is my favourite recipe. This is beneficial for a good health. I really appreciate the efforts of this blog author. Please keep it up. Thanks again!! The best salsa recipe!! Thank you! This is my absolute favorite homemade salsa. I think the San Marzano tomatoes make it! I’ve made it with other canned tomatoes and it’s tough to get the right taste. Pingback: Pingback: This is a fantastic recipe! My only issue with it is that the metric conversions are wrong. It’s using “ml” for dry ingredients. Milliliters is a measurement for liquids, not solids, or in this recipe, powders. The metric ingredients should all be in grams. ml is a volume measurement. This is no different then asking for 1 cup of flour or 1 tablespoon of flour. With water, the conversion to weight is very simple as 1ml of water = 1 gram of water, or 1000ml = 1 liter = 1 kilogram. My absolute favorite salsa recipe! I believe it is the mixture of both fresh and canned tomatoes used in this recipe that made the difference, and made this recipe truly special. I only made one adjustment. I like spice, so I kicked the heat up by adding about a tablespoon of siracha, since I didn’t have access to habanero peppers at the time. It was delicious! I’ve made this salsa many times now and even gave small jars away as a parting gift to guests at my birthday brunch. Thank you! Pingback: Great base recipe and so customizable. I prefer. Bright, fresh tasting salsa, so I did half of the fire-roasted tomatoes, extra cilantro, and extra lime. It came out just perfect. ☺️ Taste as you go so that it comes out just how you want. Pingback: Taught my g-daughter this recipe to teach her how to read a recipe and cook it. Came out delicious. Great recipe! They look delicious and easy to make. My favorite one is the Homemade Salsa. I think I will give it a try and make it now. Thank You! I love to cook. Finding and updating new menu recipes every day makes me more interested and interested in my work. Today’s my lucky day, Homemade Salsa is great, just follow the instructions and everything is easy, I like that. Thanks for sharing the great recipe.!! Super Tasty.!!! For some reason, I love cooking your recipes. It looks delicious, for sure this Homemade Salsa is going to be on my table tonight. Thank you, Sommer Collier, for this simple yet delicious looking recipe. !! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SALSA RECIPE!! It has become my go to recipe. I have adjusted some of the ingredients to suit my tastes and I have had NOTHING but compliments. THANK YOU!!! Look it delicous and taste great Too onion-y :( I use half an onion or even a quarter red onion. They are pretty strong and not everyone like oniony salsa. :-) Looks yummy. I’ve tried to make this for my family, and my family really love it. I will introduce your recipe for my friends. Thank you so much. I love it. Do I have to remove the seeds from the tomatoes I never remove my tomato seeds or my chili seeds. I have had nothing but compliments on this recipe. :-) Can you can this recipe in canning jars with hot water bath Thank you for sharing. It looks so yummy. It is well balanced and easy to make more than I thought, even after being refrigerated for several days. Highly recommend for everyone. Made this twice now and it’s a winner!! My adult son came over and had some and asked if it was his grandma’s salsa!! That’s a compliment! We are in Texas so we love our salsa!!! Thanks for the recipe! I used monk fruit sweetener instead of sugar… My food processor was full to the max shorting out! Added more lime juice and tons of cilantro! Amazing! It is really well balanced, tastes fresh, and the perfect kind of red salsa that you’d want! This is truly the best salsa we’ve tried. It beats the ones from the restaurants and from the jar. Thank you so much for sharing this with us!! Hello Sommer Collier, That’s great article about best homemade salsa recipe. keep your good job. My wife is officially addicted to this Wow!! This really IS the best! Rivals my favorite taco spots’ salsas. I made a half recipe & it filled a quart jar. I couldn’t get San Marzano tomatoes crushed at my grocery so I got a 28oz can of Cento organic San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes which I fished out of the can & pulsed to a crushed consistency in the blender. FYI – a 28 oz can became roughly 15oz when the actual tomatoes were separated from the sauce in the can. Pingback: I made this dish with fun. I love recipe. It is simple and easy. Can’t wait to make this. Pictures are mouthwatering !! Yummy. Great food. Thank you for amazing article. Can I double this recipe? I like this review of you, same point of view I used 20 cherry tomatoes in place of the 4 regular tomatoes and it turn out great. Plus I didn’t have to core and quarter the tomatoes, so that saved time, and it was a good way to use up the cherries, as we all seem to have too many at times. This was fun to make, and eat. Thank you, Sommer. I’ve never made salsa at home in my entire life, following the passion for cooking realizes me to start making dishes and try something new daily. Your this recipe made me craving for having a salsa right now and it looks so tasty in those alluring pictures Pingback: Made the recipe. Love it… just curious if it can be canned Thanks Hi Crystal, Because of the raw ingredients, this is not a good canning recipe. Pingback: Awesome recipe! Great stuff! Added little more cilantro. Great recipe. I didn’t have fresh tomatoes so I used rotel tomatoes with green chili and it worked great! Can I us3 blender I don’t have food processor Hi Sandy, Sure thing! Just to sure to pulse, not fully puree. :) Delicious if l may say so myself. Excellent recipe!! No need to search for other recipes. Used 1 t of sugar to balance acidity. Can I preserve this recipe by canning it? I would like to know the same thing. Can we can this recipe in jars? If you can can tomatoes you certainly can can this salsa. TL;DR Yes! Hi Steph, Because this recipe is not fully cooked, it’s not safe for canning. However, you can freeze it! Hi Carrie, Because the salsa is not fully cooked, it not good for canning. However, you can freeze it! Pingback: You shouldn’t need to cook it. You WILL need to extricate enough water with a strainer to make the consistency how you like it. Leave 1/4-1/2 inch of space when freezing. You should like the “taste of summer” if frozen properly. My $.02… Hi – delicious recipe! For those with the “onion too strong” thing, soak your onion in white or apple cider vinegar for 60-90 secs, It “de-strongs” them! This is a Rick Bayless trick I learned. Also, I have lots of yellow, and sungolds which are really sweet. Would they work ok with the San Marino crushed tomatoes? Can I use a regular ninja blender? I don’t have a good processor. Hi Jennifer, Probably… I haven’t made it in a Ninja, but there should be enough liquid to make it work. Let me know how it turns out! :) I just made it in a Ninja and it worked great! Second time making the recipe and I love it. Thanks! I love this salsa! While I saw a couple of comments that the onion was too strong, I found the balance of flavors to be perfect. (In the interest of full disclosure, I do not like onions generally.) I did not have San Marzano tomatoes in my pantry, but the fire roasted tomatoes that I did have added a great flavor. Perfect as is – I wouldn’t change a thing! Do you need to peel the tomatoes? No need to peel the tomato…☺ Hi Christy, No, you can leave the peels on. :) Very good recipe except I will omit the sugar. I feel it ruined it because it was sweet. I had to add more lime juice and peppers to offset the sweetness. I will make it again but minus the sugar next time. Can you freeze this salsa without cooking it? Hi Mindy, You can definitely freeze this salsa. It won’t have the exact same fresh quality when you thaw it, but it will still taste good! This is restaurant style salsa. Yum. Homemade salsa is the best with fresh ingredients from the garden. Family approved. I split up my salsa, one with jalapeno pepper one without. It was excellent I used 2 jalapeños and 1 Carolina reaper. Can you can this with a pressure cooker? I wondered because you can raw can that wa. Best salsa recipe i have found yummy ,I ate over half of it yummy ,Thank You Vicky Just simply yummy. I ONLY like homemade salsa – and I swear, I could eat the entire batch in one sitting. This recipe is exactly what I love about summer. In the interest of scaling back the heat, I only used one jalapeño and it is VERY mild. I highly recommend this recipe. Love this recipie… 💖💗 This is my go to in the summer. I have many tomatoes in the garden. I use whatever weighs out to roughly 15 oz. I have more cherry/grape tomatoes than anything so I use that…still works and has that great flavor! Excellent recipe! I didn’t add any sugar. This is my 2nd batch this week. I used one packet of “Sugar in the Raw” and added a teaspoon of chili powder. It wasn’t too sweet. Looks great! The recipe is quite simple and easy to prepare, added to the menu for this weekend. Hope to enjoy the delicious Homemade Salsa with my family. Thanks and have a nice day! I made this salsa last year after visiting my local Farmers Market “Hot Pepper Festival” in Lexington, Kentucky. I used all fresh tomatoes (red and yellow) and did not use anything from a can because I had tons of fresh summer heirloom tomatoes on hand! It was my first attempt at homemade salsa and it was a huge success! Very easy and fresh, but I shouldn’t have added the can of crushed tomatoes. It was so flavorful with everything else. The crushed tomatoes took away from the flavors and spice. FANTASTIC and EASY! Do you think I could use a bunch of cherry and grape tomatoes for the tomatoes. We just got a ton of those in. Awesome salsa!! Very flavorful! I like heat so I added a jalapeño and kept the insides…perfection! Holy Smokes! This was delicious. I split the recipe in half because I was worried that I wouldn’t like it enough to eat it all. WHAT A MISTAKE! I can’t get enough of this stuff. thank you for sharing the recipe! I’ve been looking for an excuse to get a food processor, what size would be best for this recipe? What size do you use? I also like to add Mexican oregano, shredded sharp cheddar cheese and shredded monterey jack cheese Fantastic salsa recipe, this from a produce gardening/selling family! We have experimented long and wide with various fresh tomatoes, peppers, herbs – never occurred to me to add canned (store bought), but it works! Actually, we used Rotel (2 cans drained) instead of the canned San Marzanos and green chiles, was what we had on hand. Everything else exactly as in recipe. So great! Thanks for our new go-to red tomato salsa! Excellent salsa…. Quick, easy and tasty. Good recipe but should not have put the cumin in it ! Very strong and overpowering . Made it a second time with no cumin and used all fresh peppers and tomatoes and was great . Thank you for this recipe ! I couldn’t find crushed san marzano tomato’s. Will regulate crushed tomatoes work? Hi Matt, Absolutely! Any canned tomatoes will work, the San Marzano tomatoes just have a really lovely flavor. ;) My mother loved the salsa i made for her. Thanks for the amazing recipe This is hands down the best salsa I have ever eaten. All my friends want this recipe. I did not use sugar and I added two green tomatoes. I added hot green chili and 1 large jalapeño and it was not too hot. I now own my forth batch in two weeks. Fantastic I have not done this yet. What I need to know. Can you make this recipe without a food processor? Hi Sandra, If you have a good high-power blender you can use that. Otherwise, it’s a lot of fine hand-chopping. :) Excellent, easy to make. Highly recommend!! Yes!!! Loved it Yes!!! The entire family enjoyed it!! I also added some Cheyenne pepper powder to a batch to make it spicy!!! Thank you so much for sharing Best Homemade Salsa Recipe is great! I made it according to your recipe and the taste is great! Everyone in the family likes it, it makes me happy. thank you I made your spicy salsa and it came out sweet! What’s can I do now? Hi Connie, Did you add sugar? It’s best to go light on the sugar at first, to determine how acidic your tomatoes are. However, you can always add more lime juice to balance out the sweetness. My family and I all love this recipe! It is our favorite and so easy to make. This is some great salsa that I make all the time accept, I don’t use a food processor I’d rather cut everything by hand….. Keeping it on the chunky side is more how my family likes it. WOW! MUCH better than ANY store bought I’ve ever had. Can’t wait for my kids to try this later. Thanks! Pingback: I made this this weekend to go with the barbacoa I was making. I wish I hadn’t added the sugar, I used roma tomatoes and the marzano tomatoes which I think both had some sweetness to a degree. I gave my hubby some before I added the lime juice and he liked it, after I mixed in the lime juice he didn’t like it as much. We did enjoy the salsa, but next time I will leave out the sugar. My go to pepper is the serrano, but the jalapenos were only available. Not quite the best, but really good, thank you for the recipe. I look forward to trying out more of your recipes. This was such a lovely recipe and so simple to make. Thankyou!! :) I love this recipe! Just a few tweaks I made due to preference and lack of ingredients on hand: 1) I omitted the cilantro since I didn’t have any. 2) I didn’t have jalapeño either, so added a few teaspoons of red pepper flakes instead for some kick. 3) I reduced the amount of onion…used 1/8th of a red onion the first time I made it, and 1/4-1/2 of a yellow onion this time. Turned out amazing both times!!! Can you can this recipe? This is my favorite salsa! Hi Marla, Sorry, because some of the ingredients are fully raw, it is not a canning recipe. You would have to cook it a little first, which would change the flavor. However, I have heard from some readers that they freeze it, and it thaws pretty well. Can you make a large amount of this salsa and freeze it or store it for longer times? She says above you can freeze it if you wrap the container in foil. The Best Homemade Salsa Recipe is great! I made it according to your recipe and the taste is great! Everyone in the family likes it, it makes me happy. Thank you This had become our go to recipe for salsa… it’s absolutely perfect consistency and taste! Made this today and wow! It was so good, I had a heart attack a month ago and I have to watch my sodium intake. This is healthier and tastes better than any store-bought salsa! Thank you for this amazing recipe!! I made this today for my family and it was delicious! I may regret it tomorrow, but I added a couple of extra roasted jalapeños. An extra couple of pinches of salt and cumin as well. Turned out really good. I made this today. Really tasty! Didn’t include onion only because I don’t like it. Added some cayenne. I just chopped up all the ingredients very finely. Then I used an immersion blender after I added the crushed tomatoes. Will definitely make again! Finally made this today and it was delicious! Pingback: This is the ABSOLUTE BEST salsa I’ve ever had. My mother in law wanted homemade salsa for mothers day. I’ve never made it before, so I just googled, read the reviews and gave it a try. I’m so glad I did…..everyone at the cookout said it was the best they’ve ever had. My husband has put it on his chicken the past 2 days. I had it with my eggs this am. It has made it to my permanent recipe book. I look forward to making this in the future. So healthy, fresh and delicious! Thanks so much!!!! I have made this salsa a dozen times, all with rave reviews from those who eat it. I do make two batches, as one I kick up a notch by adding a few smokey chipotle peppers. I slight modify by not putting the onions in along with the rest of the veggies first… they tend to get to finely choppped/mushy so I add them in later to integrate. I also use Roma tomatoes. And by all means, take a small nibble out of the jalapenos to determine their heat level.. some are like bellpeppers, some are the hottest things ever! You’ll need to adjust accordingly. My husband said it was the best salsa he ever had! Now that’s a compliment! Very good, thank you for sharing! I added a chopped up tomato at the end to make it slightly chunky. Delicious recipe The cumin just didn’t do it for us… it was very overpowering and we used 1 1/2 tsp. I think it would’ve been 5 stars without it. Pingback: What I favorite first to love is your presentation, is very beautiful, and attract readers. How you share very clear and intelligibility. Thank you. This was a great salsa recipe – but wondering if I can omit the sugar? I liked the recipe. I did not add the canned tomatoes, used 1 serrano and 3 jalapenos with the Hatch canned hot green chilies. Turned out great!! It has heat; how I like it, and there is a lot of salsa. Pingback: This formula was right on the money!! So great! It is fiery however even with de-seeding the jalapeños. What’s more, I like fiery stuff. Excellent! This recipe makes me want to grow tomatoes and limes! So stinkin’ good! I’ll never buy store bought again. Just amazing! It tastes exactly like the restaurant kind! Very fresh. I’ll be making this again. I just made this, and I thought that the canned tomatoes kind of ruined the fresh flavor I enjoy from salsa. It turned out great in consistency, and it made a lot of salsa. It just wasn’t to my taste. For not having to boil, char, roast, or smoke anything, this is an EXCELLENT recipe. I added a teaspoon of chili powder (and an extra habanero or two, because I love heat) to balance out the raw veggie-ness with some smokier flavor and was very happy with this batch of salsa. I have not tried a tablespoon of chipotle pepper sauce, but that might be the next tried alteration. Thanks for taking the time and sharing. Delicious made it twice now. We have said goodbye to store bought salsa with this recipe :) Tried several fresh salsa recipes, this one is the best by far. Thank you for sharing Turned out great! I roasted the veggies and added a Serrano and Anaheim pepper. Also used hot green Chiles. We like it spicy. Def is my new salsa recipe. ****I have a question please**** Do you cook the veggies first? Or we doing this all raw? Thanks Hi Stephanie! No, you do not need to cook the fresh veggies at all. The combination of raw veggies mixed with cooked canned vegetables is what creates the complex flavor. :) This is awesome! We are not corn-chip people, so this will probably go over eggs… or toast… it makes quite a bit, so I froze some! This recipe is awesome. She is 100% correct about using half fresh and half canned tomatoes. The only thing i switched was I used fresh jalepenos instead of canned green chili’s. I loved it! Pingback: WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY too much onion. Ended up needing to double everything else, and the onion was still overpowering (and I love onion). Perhaps I just had a whopper of an onion? Otherwise, the flavors were extremely good. Will definitely make again with about 1/4 of the onion. I agree! The onion was so overpowering that everything else tasted a bit bitter. But other than that, it tasted good. The Best Homemade Salsa Recipe is great! This is my family’s favorite food, it’s great to be able to prepare them at home for everyone to enjoy. Thanks for your detailed tutorial, I just need to follow and everything is easy. Best regards! I DID make it! I had a pretty good recipe, but I like this better! I particularly like her style! Using both types of tomatoes! Very true! This is an amazing recipe, and now my families go to salsa choice! As in most Mexican dishes, this uses cilantro. I’m one of those folks who doesn’t care for the taste. (It’s actually been said to be a genetic thing.) Would you suggest replacing the cilantro with parley or just leave it out? Hi Sandi! I would try leaving it out at first, and then add in a little parsley if you think it needs it. Glad you asked this. My hubby doesn’t like cilantro either. I was wondering the same thing…leave it out or substitute. With so many other flavors in here, I’ll try leaving it out. Thanks! This is now my main, go-to salsa. I tweak it a bit here and there but really they’re just slight modifications to your recipe. Thanks! I am losing weight and am looking for some recipes to complete my weight loss schedule. so lucky i found you If you have more, can I learn more? How can I contact you here? thank you very much. hi, I made this recipe and it was delicious. I made it for a gathering and got excellent reviews with it. I give it 5 stars, easy to put together, much better than store bought or restaurant salsa. Making more for a friend and also putting a twist on it with tomatillos. Best salsa I have had EVER. This recipe is delicious, I have made salsa for years and this is spot on with flavor. The only thing I changed was the tomatoes. I typically use Roma tomatoes but I have also tried the recipe exactly as written and it is very good. I love this site. SO good! Substituted the 3 Jalepeno’s for 4 Smoked Chipotle Peppers out of my garden (Jalepenos smoked dry) This was delicious! Thank you for the recipe. The can of crushed tomatoes made all the difference. Wonderful depth of flavor. I made this and it was delicious! I substituted the salt with caldo de pollo powder and it added even more depth to the salsa. Give it a try! This dish is suitable for a party, I will make it for my family. thank you. I really like fruits and vegetables, it’s great that I’ve found it here. The food is actually guaranteed and very beneficial to health. Wow! This is fabulous! I found the San Marzano tomatoes to be quite expensive, so I replaced with Market Pantry, which was much less expensive. Used only one jalapeno, and was plenty spicy for my family. Simple materials, easy to buy, instructions very easy to understand. I love this dish This is pretty close to the recipe I always use to make salsa but it never occurred to me to roast the tomatoes, onions and peppers! I normally just chop up some fresh Roma tomatoes (too much liquid and lack of flavor in canned tomatoes) but I will definitely be roasting everything next time. Great idea…thanks for sharing!!! First time trying any salsa. Love this one!!! Overflowing with tomatoes out the garden. Thanks The first time I knew this recipe, it was very special and different from the food I’ve tried. I want to go to the kitchen now. Thank you for sharing! Do the tomatoes need to be peeled? Hi Matt, No, they are fine in the salsa! Let the food processor do all the work for you. :) I love to cook. Finding and updating new menu recipes every day makes me more interested and interested in my work. Today’s my lucky day, The Best Homemade Salsa Recipe is great, just follow the instructions and everything is easy, I like that. Thanks for your sharing I recently made this recipe and it was a hit with my family and one of the best salsas I’ve ever made. I agree that the mix of fresh and canned ingredients creates a nice mix of flavors that neither fresh nor canned items could achieve on their own. And it was just about the right amount of “heat” to satisfy everyone’s tastes. I highly recommend this recipe and if you like things a little hotter, just add more jalapeños or a tiny habanero. I just made this today, with a few twists of my own, and tomorrow it’s entering a contest. I thought it was pretty tasty, tomorrow should be even better. We’ll see if she wins :) Delish! Made it exactly by recipe, and it did not disappoint! my wife cooked this. and i love it I recently moved to south Brazil ( Curitiba region ) and unfortunately people here do not share the zest of spicier foods as their brothers and sisters in the northeast ( Bahia, Rio etc.. ) Finding a salsa here is easier said than done and finding one with the quality and bite that I am used to is almost impossible. Sure I bring some back once a year from the states but is a pain in the butt and within a month or two it is gone. This recipe is the best I have used so far. Like the title says ” fully adjustable “. My wife ( from this region of Brazil ) likes the more mild flavor and likes the fact she can I can make her a batch that is quite a bit milder than what I like. This salsa simply kicks ass! The only thing I had to modify from the original was to substitute parsley for the cilantro for I am one of the rare humans that cilantro tastes like soap. I could not recommend this recipe enough. Thank you! Wow, Great and Easy Recipe of salsa. This salsa is fantastic! This really is the best salsa recipe. I tried a handful of others, but this is the clear winner. Reviews from my friends and family were 5 star. One even thought I should enter the local salsa contest! Thank you so much for sharing. This is a great and easy recipe. I do cut back on the Lime juice and I use Rotel versus the green chilis. The only changes I made to the recipe was no cilantro and instead if canned tomatoes, we had some steak tomatoes that I smoked until they were soft enough for the skin to peel off. Fantastic recipe! Made as directed and it was amazing! Thank you! Awesome base recipe, thank you! My sister and I still felt it needed a little depth so we added a small jar of chipotle peppers. It added a bunch of flavor without overpowering the veggies so I’d highly recommend that addition Have you tried to can the salsa? It’s awesome and I’d like to make more but wasn’t sure it would store well under these directions. I imagine you may have to cook it first, but wasn’t sure. I’m a bit of a canning beginner, so any direction would be welcome. Plus, I have a pressure canner I’m itching to use. Hi Brian, Yes, you right. Because this recipe has raw components, it’s not great for canning. However, you can FREEZE it! In order to can it, you’d have to cook it and that would definitely change the overall fresh flavor. I will be canning it. Just cook it first, as you said. You can look at a salsa recipe geared toward canning, look at this one, adjust as needed. Don’t eat your canned goods until November. Any mistakes will make themselves known by then. Easy peasy! This is the best. Have made it for 3 different friends . They all loved it. It is on my weekly cooking list. The best I have ever had. Pingback: Yummy! Thanks for sharing the great recipe! I’ll try it now This is interesting , haven’t tried it before so don’t know how does it taste, but I wanna make some. Thanks for the recipe Can I use a blender? I don’t have a good processor. I used a blender to make mine. I would suggest putting half of the ingredients in to start and not placing the onion on the bottom. Tastes great! Hi Lisa, You can if it’s a really good blender! easy to cook! Loved it. Thanks for sharing. I made this today! Best salsa everrrrrr!!!! I made this recipe and it was delicious. I made it for a gathering and got excellent reviews with it. I give it 5 stars, easy to put together, much better than store bought or restaurant salsa. Making more for a friend and also putting a twist on it with tomatillos. Best salsa I have had EVER. I made this salsa yesterday. I give it 10 stars. I have been trying various online salsas and this recipe by far is the one I will ever make absolutely the best. I think I ate a whole cup of it. It looks very delicious. I will try this. Thanks for sharing! This is a fantastic salsa recipe! Make it! Eat it! I am bringing a batch to a concert in the park this evening and I know everyone will love it! This is perfect. Like you said, the flavors of the fresh don’t fall flat, and it still tastes 100% fresh, despite the canned additions. I added a little more lime and salt, but that’s just how I like everything. The recipe is delicious as-is. Instead of canned, I roasted some tomatoes and peppers and threw them in the food processor before adding them to raw ingredients. Great combination and raw and roasted! This recipe was spot on!! So good! It is spicy though even with de-seeding the jalapeños. And I like spicy stuff. I bought an extra Serrano because I thought I’d need to up the spice but it wasn’t necessary. Took it to a party and it was gone quick! Thank you for the recipe. Can I substitute the can of tomatoes for tomato paste for flavor and color? I also roasted the jalapenos for the roasted flavor. I understand there may be some consistency difference Pingback: So simple, I will make some and store for using sometimes. Thanks a lot. Seems like a great recipe – by the way – do you have the green chile? Can you do great without it? Hi Bar Deb, Yes, you can make any omissions or substitutions you like. The canned green chiles just add a bit of depth. I’m finding for salsa recipe and I saw your post, it’s the easiest recipe I have seen. Thanks so much for sharing also the tips. That recipe looks so yummy! I’ll have to try that one. Thanks for sharing. You must try this~absolutely delicious and gorgeous. I used Fire roasted San Marzano tomatoes (a must) and roasted about 2/3 of my peppers (Jalapeño, Serrano and Fresno) and used half the sugar and next time will omit especially if you have sweet, ripe tomatoes. Would make a great gift with a bag of tortilla chips ;-) I just had a quick view for the post, but I think I can make this, so easy, I have had salsa many times , but haven’t made this dish myself. Thanks. I’ve made this on multiple occasions now, it is my GO TO recipe. Yes, it’s a little time consuming and makes a big mess, but wow can it pack an amazing flavor punch if you do it right. It is my favorite salsa in the world, nobody does it better than me. I reverse the order of instructions a little bit. I puree the canned tomatoes (I get the fire roasted kind, diced or crushed doesn’t matter) and the chilis (hot of course). Then I add the tomatoes and cilantro and garlic and pulse a little more til its just about what I’d expect out of a jarred salsa. Get your spices in there too (salt and cumin, I leave out the sugar it doesn’t add anything IMO) Then, in another bowl I’ve had the onions and jalapenos and serranos (or whatever pepper I added..I always do one jalapeno and either a habenero or serrano for the other) soaking in lime juice the whole time. Then throw that bowl in, stir a little and pulse til its nice and chunky. I don’t like perfectly smooth salsas, I want some chunk in there, particularly from the onions and peppers so that’s why I reversed the order. Sometimes I leave 1/4 of the peppers and onions out and just hand dice and stir in at the end. I’m an onion fiend, so if you’re an onion person…you might try adding them in last to leave them a little more chunky. i hope it’s healthy on cheat meal day First try at homemade salsa and now I guess I will never go back to store bought!! This was so delicious. The whole family loved it. Pingback: Thanks for Sharing. Easy to cook! just make it and enjoy. Pingback: Had an abundance of tomatoes, jalapenos and onions in the produce box this week so I tried your recipe. It was perfect! I didn’t have any green chiles so had to do without those bu it is perfect. I made two batches: One for hubby using white onion and no cilantro. This recipe is a real keeper! Great recipe. I made it two different ways at the same time since I had some questions. 1) Couldn’t find San Marzano crushed tomatoes at the store, they only had peeled san marzanos or fire roasted crushed san marzanos. So I went with half of the recipe with the peeled, and half of the recipe with the fire roasted. 2) Don’t like sweet stuff so I put sugar in my fire roasted version and none in the other. Honestly couldn’t tell much of a difference. I did 1 teaspoon in the halved recipe. Since I couldn’t tell a difference in my taste test initially, I went ahead and threw the other 1 teaspoon into the second batch just in case its one of those things that just works well as salsa sits longer. 3) Went with the “hot” chiles. They only had mild or hot at the store. Ultimately, I like this recipe very much. Its definitely hot, too hot for my husband. Not sure if all the heat came from the hot chiles or if I left some jalapeno seeds in accidentally. Next time I will use the mild chiles. I slightly prefered the fire roasted tomato version, but they were really very similar, not a big deal. I like chunkier onions in my salsa so next time I will probably throw them in chopped after processing other stuff, although this salsa would be perfect for cooking and as a topping, whereas my chunky version will work well with chips for me. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I think you really nailed it. Reminds me very much of Chuy’s Tex Mex salsa which I love (A popular Dallas/Austin Texas restaurant chain) Pingback: This is better than any restaurant salsa. Just delicious! I didn’t have any green chillies but it was good without it. Thanks for the great recipe. Pingback: Wow! You did an incredible job with this recipe! It’s delicious! My entire family loved it. Thanks so much for sharing! Made this recipe with my son (10yr old) on a rainy cold Saturday. What a success! Showing him some knife skills, taught him to use a can opener. Told stories. Substituted some of the tomato for a handful of tomatillos so I could teach him to blanch. Finally an hour or so away from technology to just talk with my son. Salsa turned out absolutely incredible btw. Thanks The store only had peeled whole San Marzano tomatoes. Would you throw the juice in there too? I just crushed them by hand and omitted because the salsa already seemed liquidy enough. It is a great recipe and one I’ll be returning too again and again! Thanks for sharing! Hi Jon, Yep, just dump it all in! :) I LOVE this salsa! I would like to can this salsa to make it last longer and give as gifts. Are there any ingredients I need to add for canning? If anyone has tried this does it change the taste? I am new to canning. Any help is appreciated! Thanks! Excellent recipe! Our Southwest(AZ),salsa recipe is great(almost identical),howevetthose fresh jalapeños add much more flavor, than our canned ones do. :) Bravo, and yum!! Thanks for sharing recipe. SC just make it and taste it Sound so delicious! Thank you for your recipe and tips to make the homemade salsa for my kids. Turned out pretty good. Stuck with recipe as posted to be safe, could use a little more heat, but everyone is different. I’m going to by sticking with the 3 jalapenos and add a habanero to it. Perfect recipe to tweak to your individual taste. I omitted the sugar also. Thanks for your recipe !! It’s looks delicious Pingback: Really good salsa! nice and fresh!easy to make. I put everything in the food processor and it was done in a couple of minutes. Honey?! I can honestly say I went, eww….wait that could be yummy. I just picked a bunch of veggies from the garden last night and I cant wait to make this recipe tonight. I will let you know how it turns out! Thanks for posting 🙂 Can you add cayenne pepper to this recipe why wouldn’t you be able to? I have never made my own salsa before but this is the most delicious salsa I have ever had. If I do say so myself! It is so fresh and so perfect taste I wouldn’t change anything or add anything loved it!!!! Pingback: Pingback: Goog very good Made this yesterday w/my sister & we served it to our husbands & they thought it was the best ever! We all couldn’ Stop eating it!! Also so easy to make. I added a step. If you like salsa w/o tomato skins, just slice in half & lay face down on sheet pan w/parchment paper. In oven on broil about 5 minutes, the skins wrinkle right up & pull off easily! Pingback: I made this for the first time yesterday It’s so easy and it’s out of this world delicious. Will definitely be making this more often. No more store bought salsa for us. Pingback: Pingback: Pingback: Vegan Gluten Free Salsa – Latin Corner Pingback: I made it to the recipe. Just need to spice it up some more. Could be a little hotter for me but has a great taste. Think I will add a couple habeneros next time. We made this last summer and loved it! This year we are trying to not have any ‘added sugar ‘ to our meals. Would this taste okay without the sugar? Or has anyone tried that? Pingback: Pingback: Sooo yummy! Thank you! Pingback: This is a wonderful salsa. my family loves it but it dose make alot. How could i cut this in half. They did say it can be frozen. Next time you want some, it’s right there, waiting to be thawed. Pingback: This is the best salsa ever! My son said it tastes just like the salsa at our favorite Mexican restaurant. Forget the chips and just give me a straw ? Thanks for the recipe! Hi Debra, LOL! I could drink it with a straw as well. :) Pingback: This is pretty much my exact recipe, only I stopped measuring a long time ago and I’ve never tried using canned tomatoes along with the fresh. Fresh salsa is definitely the way to go. I can’t even eat canned salsa anymore. One thing I do sometimes to add depth is to roast the tomato, garlic, and jalapeno (just throw it all on a baking sheet and let it go for about 20 minutes at 400F, turning once if I’m not feeling too lazy). This in combo with the fresh cilantro and lime juice gets rave reviews. I bet using canned tomatoes would add a similar depth! Anyway, thanks for the recipe because I can’t remember where I got mine from and it’s nice to have the proportions to check on and make sure I don’t get too out of hand with anything. Pingback: Lunch Prep Recipes - Who Says What I would really love to try all your recipies. Especially my husband loves food.:-) I make a very similar recipe. Ours has a little less lime juice, and add some ACV. Also, e use canned diced tomatoes, but I think crushed might be even better. I can’t wait to try it! BTW, when do you add your cilantro? I couldn’t find that step in the recipe. Hi Jan, Throw it in with the fresh produce and puree! :) Can the salsa be canned? Hi Mary, I properly wouldn’t can this salsa because it’s fresh, not cooked. However, you can freeze it! :) What type of fresh tomatoes do you recommend using? Also, could you use an emulsifier stick instead of a food processor? Hi Sonya, I would use whatever kind of tomatoes you can find that are ripe and sweet. You can definitely make this with an immersion blender, but the texture may not be quite as consistent. Maybe you have one that came with a jar attachment? That would help! Just tried this salsa recipe tonight. First time making salsa actually. If I had known how easy it was and good it turn out, I should have made some much sooner. Thanks for the recipe. This is definitely a keeper. Pingback: I have made this recipe a few times. I have found that it does NOT need the added sugar What kind of tomatoes do I use? Hi, Sommer, I was pointed to your blog by Cory Kowalski. I immediately saved your detox soup recipe AND the salsa one. I love salsa and love making it, but I can’t eat as much as I’d like to because I have kidney disease (and tomatoes aren’t good for me). I am going to try making a salsa with an extra dose of tomatilos, substituting them for some of the tomatoes. I’ll let you know how it comes out. BTW, I can’t find a ‘follow’ button on your site — except pointing to Pinterest, which I know nothing about. Please check out my FoodTradeTrends.com blog and my other one, YouSayWHAT.info. Doug Pingback: Pingback: I had save this recipe cause I knew it would be good, and it proved to be the best one I’ve ever made. My ratios of spices and peppers were a little altered, and I had a can of Muir Glen fire roasted, crushed tomatoes which added a little more depth perhaps, but it’s a big winner. I filed this in “Make Again” for sure! Thank you – love your emails. Hi Cheryl, Yay!! I’m so glad you liked it.

When you thaw it , put it in a colander to drain some of the water from it before serving. Homemade salsa is the best! This looks fresh and delicious! Yes i agree but don’t you think green chillies would make it too spicy to handle. Sommer, I just got a food processor. Who knew salsa was THAT easy. Now, where to find decent tortilla chips in Ireland. Hmmm? Thanks for another good one. BTW – I’m also eyeing the fig/prosciutto pizza & blueberry cake. Best, Glenn K.

Serve it with tortilla chips or spoon over enchiladas, tacos and more. When Mexican food is on the menu, salsa is an essential. This easy salsa recipe is so good, once you try it you’ll have a hard time buying store-bought salsa again. It’s fresh, spicy and totally addicting! Just like my , this salsa recipe is made with simple ingredients. It’s easy to adjust the flavors to your tastes, and you can make it more or less spicy. Serve it with your favorite Mexican recipes, including , and . Find the full recipe with ingredient amounts and instructions in the recipe card below. Making this homemade salsa is as simple as putting the ingredients in your food processor (or blender) and pulsing until the salsa is blended to your desired consistency. You can make it thinner or chunkier – however you like it! You’ll add the ingredients to the food processor in two batches. Start with the onion, garlic and jalapeño and pulse a few times to chop. Adding these ingredients first ensures that they are finely chopped and allows you to then pulse the tomatoes to your desired consistency. When adding the canned tomatoes, drain off and discard the liquid from the diced tomatoes with green chilies. Add the juices from the can of fire roasted diced tomatoes to the food processor. Pulse a few times until the salsa is your desired consistency. You can serve the salsa right away, but for the best flavor chill it in the fridge for about an hour before serving to allow the flavors to develop. I always taste my salsa on a tortilla chip to see if the flavors are right against the salty chip. You can add a little more lime juice, salt and pepper or sugar if needed to make the flavor of your salsa just perfect! While I am all for using fresh ingredients whenever possible, I use canned tomatoes in this salsa recipe. Canned tomatoes are available year-round and make this recipe come together quickly. Fresh tomatoes can be too juicy to make a good salsa, and, unless you roast them a bit, could make a less flavorful salsa. (Save those fresh tomatoes to make !) If you have ripe, fresh tomatoes and want to use them in this salsa recipe, I recommend using a combination of fresh and canned. Make sure your fresh tomatoes are firm and a deep red color. Adding canned tomatoes will add depth of flavor to your salsa, especially if you use fire roasted tomatoes – which I highly recommend! This salsa can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 7-10 days. posted by on May 5, 2022 (last updated Mar 13, 2023 ) Subscribe and receive FREE family meal plans , right to your inbox, plus exclusive subscriber-only content!

And I agree, it is so much better than jarred salsa! This is delicious! I followed the recipe as is. Except I used bottled lime juice. I forgot to get a lime. I used a whole jalapeno. Thanks for the easy recipe. I’ll make it again for sure. I’ll probably have to make the less spicy version for the family that doesn’t like spice. I bet it will still be wonderful! I’m so glad you enjoyed this! Isn’t it so addicting? 😉 This is so good! I made it 3 times this week for my extended family, and shared the recipe with them. One question – have you tried to freeze it? Hi Mary Jo, I’m so happy to hear that! I haven’t tried to freeze it. My guess is that it would freeze ok, I’m just not sure if the raw onions would become too strong after freezing and thawing. Let me know if you try it! What out canning I am not sure – I don’t have experience with canning. Will it get spicier after sitting in the ice box over night? Hi Aubrey, It may get a little spicier in the refrigerator overnight. Been looking for a good salsa recipe, i wont look any further, just made this moments ago, o my gosh, taste just like my restuarant serves, love it, love it, love it.This is the best salsa ever, thanks for sharing. I’m so glad you love this recipe as much as I do! Thank you for taking the time to leave a comment. Made this for a mexican night with friends and everyone loved it! I added extra salt but that was it. Really really good and doesnt make a huge bowl so I wont be storing a ton of salsa. A little ashamed that at 50 years old I have never attempted to make salsa. This year we are boycotting traditional Thanksgiving turkey this year and doing tacos 5 ways with all the trimming. I did a trial run of this salsa today and it is really easy to make and tastes fabulous. Will be making it again at thanksgiving Your Thanksgiving plan sounds so delicious! I’m glad that this salsa recipe will be part of your holiday meal. 🙂 Pretty good, made it super GREAT when I added two of my homegrown ghost peppers in it. Mmm spicaaayyy. Awesome! Made it for my daughter – she loved it. It’s definitely a keeper. Thanks!! Hi, haven’t tried making it yet, but wondered if sweet Vidalia or Mayan onions are also okay in this recipe. I haven’t tried the salsa with either of those, but they would probably work fine. Enjoy! Can I used jarred minced garlic if I don’t have whole garlic? That should work well. Enjoy! Very easy and tasty AND I had all ingredients on hand when I needed salsa in a hurry! Thank you for the recipe. The best salsa ever!!! So easy and delicious!! Thank you!! Love making salsa. I use ripe tomatoes (from garden when I have to many). I freeze them and then let thaw in colander to drain juice. I also use canned tomatoes and al the other stuff in recipe. How long it can keep in refrigerator with n without using preservatives? Hi Delani, I usually refrigerate 2-3 days but it will last for a week. Be sure to spoon from the refrigerated container into a new container for use so that the original container is not left out unrefrigerated repeatedly. OMG this was amazing!!!! I didn’t add the sugar, or garlic (I’m allergic) but OMG I’m never buying salsa again. Thank you so much for this recipe. Hope your having a great day. Also, draining the tomatoes helped greatly. The This is such a good salsa recipe, I’ve made it several times and it’s always a hit. This most recent time instead of using jalapeños (I was out), I used the hot Rotel diced tomatoes with habaneros and it turned out really good. My favorite salsa. I omit the jalapeño and instead of small can tomatoes with green chilies I use small can tomatoes with habanero. Perfect amount heat!! How long does the salsa last? I was going to put it into jars You can store the salsa in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 7-10 days. The kids kept asking for salsa from the store, decided to try this recipe. It is fantastic! Maybe next time I’ll use fresh tomatoes, but this is outstanding! The heat was perfect with 1/2 jalapeno! Thanks!! Great idea to try fresh tomatoes. This is better than store bought and better than restaurant salsa! Made this salsa today……. Loved it !!! Can’t wait to have margaritas, chips and salsa outside around the fire table this spring if we ever get “spring” in Wisconsin ? I’ve been making this salsa for a couple of years now and it always gets rave reviews! I laugh because it tastes so fresh, yet it calls for canned items. Love this recipe. Have made it a few times. AWESOME SALSA! Easy to make. This is my favorite. Love the fire roasted tomatoes! Wow, wow, wow! Excellent. The fire roasted tomato is the ticket. I added bell pepper, smaller amount of jalapeno (if it were just me I would have put ghost pepper and probably 2 but my wife…) added a tad more salt. It’s very addicting. Just made this salsa. So fresh and yummy!!!!! For me the spice was just right. Next time I will add all the Jalapeño to meet the others in my family that like Spicy. Also so easy to make.

        "html_text": "Homemade pico de gallo is the best! This simple salsa recipe is made with chopped fresh tomatoes, chili peppers, red onion, cilantro, and lime. Eat it fresh with tortilla chips! What is one sign of a good taqueria? The salsa, of course! Or I should use the plural and say salsas? Who doesn’t love having a variety of salsas to choose from, whether dining at a taco truck or full-on restaurant? Often there’s , red chili salsa, and my favorite, a fresh tomato salsa otherwise known as pico de gallo or salsa fresca. Fresh tomato salsa is ideally made with firm, fleshy tomatoes. You can of course make the salsa with any kind of tomato, but the firm ones like Romas or hothouse tomatoes will hold up the best. When using fresh chili peppers always taste first before adding! Some peppers are hotter than others and you really can't tell unless you taste them. Just take a very small taste. You'll be able to gauge the heat of the pepper and will be better able to judge how much you need. Be very careful while handling the chili peppers. If you can, avoid touching the cut peppers with your hands. (I often use disposable gloves or hold the peppers with a plastic sandwich bag.) Rub your hands with a little olive oil before handling (to protect your skin), and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water after handling and avoid touching your eyes for several hours. If you like a salsa with less heat, remove the ribs and seeds from the peppers. But you can always set aside some of the seeds—if the salsa isn't hot enough, you can add a few for more heat. This homemade salsa recipe is easy to make. You just need chopped up fresh tomatoes, chilis, onions, cilantro, some lime juice, and seasonings. Note that because this particular salsa recipe is made with fresh ingredients, it will last as long as you would expect cut fresh tomatoes to last. It's best eaten right after you make it. Chilled, the salsa should last about 5 days or so. Use this homemade salsa fresca as a dip for or serve it with , tacos, burritos, , pinto or . Salsa, in Spanish, simply means sauce and can take a variety of forms. Pico de gallo (a.k.a. salsa fresca) is a type of salsa made with chopped fresh tomatoes and onions, cilantro, fresh chilis, lime juice, and salt. With its chunky nature and relatively low amount of liquid, pico de gallo is a lot like a relish in texture. As it's a fresh salsa, it needs to be kept refrigerated and will keep for up to 5 days. Other salsas, such as , are often made with similar ingredients as pico de gallo but are cooked and/or pureed, giving them a saucier consistency. This homemade salsa recipe is for a rather traditional pico de gallo but you can always switch things up, depending on your tastes and the ingredients you have on hand. When using fresh chili peppers, always taste first before adding! Some peppers are hotter than others and you really can't tell unless you taste them. Just take a very small taste. You'll be able to gauge the heat of the pepper and will be better able to judge how much you need. 2 to 3 medium fresh tomatoes (1 to 1 1/2 pounds), stems removed 1/2 medium red onion 2 serrano or 1 jalapeño pepper , stems, ribs, and seeds removed (less or more to taste) Juice of 1 lime 1/2 cup chopped cilantro Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 pinch dried oregano (crumble in your fingers before adding), or more to taste 1 pinch ground cumin , or more to taste Roughly chop the tomatoes, chili peppers, and onions. Be careful while handling the chili peppers. Use a plastic baggie or disposable gloves to handle them, or wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water after handling and avoid touching your eyes for several hours. Set aside some of the seeds from the peppers. If the salsa isn't hot enough, you can add a few for more heat. Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade. Pulse only a few times, just enough to finely dice the ingredients and not enough to purée. If you don't have a food processor, you can finely dice by hand. Place in a serving bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the chilis make the salsa too hot, add some more chopped tomato. If it's not hot enough, carefully add a few of the seeds from the chilis, or add a little more ground cumin. If you like, let the salsa sit for an hour (room temperature or chilled) for the flavors to combine. Serve with chips, tortillas, tacos, burritos, tostadas, , or pinto or black beans. The salsa will keep refrigerated for up to 5 days. When you visit the site, Dotdash Meredith and its partners may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

I loved this recipe!!! Made it for serving with chicken quesadillas and the family loved the spicy kick! I used red onion instead of yellow but left it in cold water with some vinegar to soften the bite. Lots of cilantro of course and what I had left over I used it with a smashed avocado to make a chunky guacamole. Thanks for sharing this recipe!! xoxo Really good! I used what I had so I subbed red onion and only used 1 jalapeno. With seeds left in this has quite the heat! I left out the cumin just based on personal preference. Thanks for the recipe and the reminder that making your own salsa is mich easier than I always seem to think. So easy, right?! I’m glad you’re loving this one 🙂 I was looking at your recipe and this look very similar to Chilean PEBRE, This salsa is used as side dishes for meat, fish and is eating with nice fresh bread called MARRAQUETA. Love to make it with chilean CHILLI trhat have a very special taste and smell. Thanks so much for sharing, Barbara! Hope you can try it soon 🙂 Loved it, very easy too. Flavorful, thanks Monique! — I mean, Tony! 😄 Haha I’ll tell him!! So glad you loved it 🙂 easy and delicious!! Yay! I’m glad you enjoyed this! Oh my goodness! Made this tonight with Roma tomatoes. I couldn’t get fresh cilantro and I’ll add next time. It was so delicious!!! Thanks Dagon. I’ll be making this again and again. Awesome, I’m so happy to hear you loved it!! Delicious and easy in the food processor! I didn’t use the green onion and only used one jalapeño and it still had a great kick! Awesome! I’m so glad you loved it!! Best salsa I’ve ever had! Just made a batch last night and we are loving it! We added extra lime and left out the jalapeno. I’m so glad to know its this easy to make salsa at home. My garden won’t stop producing tomatoes and salsa peppers so I keep making this recipe! It is such a hit! Every time that I’ve made it and brought it somewhere, it gets rave reviews. I’ve started adding in bell peppers and they give a little extra color. Everyone loves it! Oh yay!! Glad that you + everyone else is loving it so much 🙂 Fun to use garden ingredients too! vefry nice recipe yummy recipe So easy! Started making this a bunch last year and we still continue to today. Just made this AGAIN! It’s so easy and very delicious! I do add more cumin (a dash or two) and let it sit overnight. Yum! Yum! Yum! Thanks for sharing Anxious to try my first recipe from you! Turkey chili. It is simmering! Ahh so exciting! I hope you love it! I’ve been making this exact salsa for years. For me personally it was a fixation with trying to make Chili’s restaurant salsa. ( Gosh I love that &$@+!!!! Anyway DO NOT SKIMP WHEN THE RECIPE CALLS FOR FRESH INGREDIENTS! Example…., Cilantro in a jar, dried up like the leaves off your tree in December, tastes nothing like a fresh chopped up bundle of cilantro that you can get at any grocery store produce dept. Also fresh lime juice in a bottle shaped like a lime tastes nothing like a real lime cut in half and squeezed until your hands hurt. This particular recipe is hands down awesome, and like they stated, is good on almost everything.. I can even drink it out if a glass sometimes in the morning in place of my am coffee!!. Bravo Tony I’m with you on this. Enjoy to those just starting, you’ll never go back to those salsas made in Texas and come in a jar again, or New York city etc etc .One quick note, garlic powder seems to taste better than minced garlic. That’s my opinion, or I just don’t hear my wife complain about my breath as much when I use the powder. Lol. SALSA LATER!!!! Hahaha omg best review ever!!! SO happy you love this one. And 100% agree about using fresh ingredients! So good! I’ve been looking for a great salsa recipe as ones I’ve tried just aren’t what I’m looking for. This is IT!! Perfect amount of spice and super easy to make! Yay!! SO glad you enjoyed it, Joanna 🙂 Wonderful salsa recipe. Enjoyed it so much. Yay! Happy you are enjoying this recipe, Georgie 😊 Nice recipe t’s so helpful for me There wasn’t much flavor.

        "html_text": "Break out the tortilla chips! This homemade salsa recipe is zesty, fresh, and super easy to make. Enjoy it as a dip, or pile it onto tacos, nachos, and more. If I learned one thing from living in Austin, it’s that homemade salsa is infinitely better than any kind you can find in a jar. I loved sampling salsas at restaurants and taco trucks. Each one was different – some were made with roasted ingredients, others got a smoky, spicy kick from dried chiles, and still others were nice and fresh. This variety inspired me to start experimenting with making homemade salsa. I might pull out in the winter, when good tomatoes are hard to find, or if I see them at the farmers market. But on hot summer days, this fresh tomato salsa recipe is the one I crave. It’s super simple to make (no cooking required!), and it’s zesty, spicy, and bright. It keeps for 3 days in the fridge, but around here, it never lasts that long. Set it out with your favorite tortilla chips, and it’ll disappear in a snap! You only need a few basic ingredients to make this easy salsa recipe: Find the complete recipe with measurements below. Once you learn how to make salsa at home, you’ll never buy it in a jar again! Here’s what you need to do: Start with the onion and garlic. Rinse the onion under cold running water, and add it to the food processor along with a garlic clove. Process until they’re well-chopped. Next, add the other ingredients. Toss in the diced tomatoes, jalapeño, cilantro, lime juice and zest, cumin, salt, and sugar. Pulse until everything is combined but not pureed. The texture should be chunky. Season to taste, and enjoy! Store any leftover salsa in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. If you’re anything like me, you’ll end up eating half your homemade salsa straight from the food processor. Served with tortilla chips, it’s an addictive dip! But of course, there are other delicious ways to enjoy it too. Here are a few of my favorites: How do you like to enjoy homemade salsa? Let me know in the comments!

I leave out the cilantro and sub with parsley, if I have some, though it is still great without. I’m so glad you’ve loved it! Hello just wondering if this recipe can be canned and what changes would be made. Thanks I have canned it. I simply heat it to a simmer in a pot for 5 minutes, then put in hot pint size jars and water bath for 20 minutes. I usually double the recipe. It tastes great! The ‘’best”….. so easy ..a must try!!!! The absolute best! I could eat this with a spoon! It was the absolute best! I could eat this with a spoon! I’m so glad you loved it! How long will it keep in the fridge? Hi Anna, I keep mine about 3-5 days. I won a family salsa competition with your recipe! So thank you!! This sounds amazing…I can’t wait to try it! I was wondering if you have a recipe for canning a salsa? I like to make that each fall so I have it through the winter months. This year we had an abundance of fresh big boy and Roma and other varieties of tomatoes. Just made this tonight – it delicious ! Not a big fan of cilantro so skipped that but tasted so yummy! Thanks for sharing! Absolutely lovely!!! This is so delicious! I made it with cherry tomatoes fresh from my garden. What a treat! Thank you for the awesome recipe! Wow! Found it. Thank you for posting. My phone is very slow loafing the website. All of your recipes look so fresh and delicious! Love to try all of them. Nice Work! Hi here, this looks fantastic! Do you think it would freeze well? I often freeze store bought jarred salsa and it freezes well, so just wondering about this. Thanks so much! I haven’t tried, but I think this one is probably best fresh (it might get watery thawing and freezing). It definitely tastes best fresh. That being said I have frozen it. When it thaws it just needs a stir or you could drain some of the liquid. It is great to have a fresh taste of summer in the winter. We love to eat, travel, cook, and eat some more!

It’s perfect served with tortilla chips or as a topping over your favorite Mexican food, like tacos, burritos, taquitos and so forth. The best party food around and a must-have snack! Fact: the best salsa is made with fresh tomatoes. Okay, that’s just my opinion, but in the past I thought I could go the route of using all canned tomatoes, but using fresh tomatoes makes a world of difference! Fresh tomatoes make the best salsa, especially when you use nicely ripened in season tomatoes. This is hands down my favorite salsa recipe, and I don’t know that I’ll ever need another one. It just has the perfect ratio and blend of everything. It’s not too oniony or garlicy, nor too spicy for my kids, it doesn’t tasting like it came from a can and it has the perfect brightness with the fresh lime. Then it has a classic Mexican flavor with the cilantro and hint of chili powder and cumin. The sugar I’d say is only needed if you are using store-bought tomatoes. If you grow your own or buy them at the farmers market, the quality is a bit better and they’re a bit sweeter so the sugar isn’t needed. Making salsa at home couldn’t be easier! Here’s how you’ll make it: What to go all out? Try this with homemade tortilla chips, or . Everyone will be totally impressed! I don’t make them often, but when I do it makes the fresh salsa that much better. This salsa should last for up to a week if stored in a sealed container in the fridge.

My son, who is a big salsa lover (but hates veggies—go figure lol) wasn’t a fan of this recipe. Maybe I pulsed it too much because it looked more like corse baby food How many cups does this recipe make?

        "html_text": "Salsa has been around for a very very long time. The origins date back to the Incas and Aztecs and just like it is today, it was a very popular condiment used on fish and meat to add spiciness. Most Americans use it as a dip as well as a condiment and is why we so often love to pair it with chips, but salsa in Spanish simply translates to sauce. A good, simple salsa is easy to make at home. To make ours the most flavorful salsa ever, we use both cherry tomatoes and fresh off-the-vine tomatoes. We also roast some of the ingredients to intensify their flavors and make this salsa POP! Salsa vs. Pico de Gallo The two are very similar and often include the same ingredients. The main difference between the two is that pico is made of uncooked ingredients and usually much chunkier than salsa. Salsa often has a thinner consistency from being blended together and usually includes more liquid. doesn't get blended and is typically just small diced ingredients. Fresh vs. Canned Tomatoes We much prefer fresh tomatoes in our salsa as they taste brighter and provide a better texture. If it's the dead of winter and juicy, red tomatoes are nowhere to be found, you can, of course, use canned. Just make sure you pick a can with no added ingredients like basil and drain the tomatoes of their juices. Roasting Here at Delish, we are firm believers that everything tastes better after it's been roasted ( !), and that's why we opted to roast a few of our salsa ingredients. It brings out the flavors of the jalapeños and deeply sweeten the cherry tomatoes. It takes away some of the pungency of the onion and gives it a more caramelized flavor. Food Processor While using a food processor is completely optional, it is recommended. It's the easiest and fastest way to blend all of the ingredients together. A blender can work as well, but we would recommend either working in batches or stopping to stir a few times, so that the bottom doesn't become pure liquid! Chopping all of your vegetables by hand would take a bit of time, but you can do that for more of a pico de gallo–style salsa if you prefer! Storing Salsa Fresh salsa will last for about a week tightly sealed in the refrigerator. So you can keep coming back for that midnight snack! Spiciness Levels Not a fan of major spice? That's okay. This salsa is only at a medium heat, but if you want it less spicy you can opt for only one jalapeño or none at all. If you want it even spicier leave some seeds in with the jalapeños or trade them out for a habanero or serrano pepper! Serving There's endless ways to use this versatile salsa. Some of our favorite ways: use it to whip up some , spoon it over , or serve with ! Made this yet?

        "html_text": "By: Updated: March 28, 2023 | Original: November 18, 2009 Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2022 will occur on Monday, October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of , when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning costumes and eating treats. Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of (pronounced sow-in). The , who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and northern France, celebrated their new year on November 1. This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year that was often associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night before the new year, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31 they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth. In addition to causing trouble and damaging crops, Celts thought that the presence of the otherworldly spirits made it easier for the Druids, or Celtic priests, to make predictions about the future. For a people entirely dependent on the volatile natural world, these prophecies were an important source of comfort during the long, dark winter. To commemorate the event, Druids built huge sacred bonfires, where the people gathered to burn crops and animals as sacrifices to the Celtic deities. During the celebration, the Celts wore costumes, typically consisting of animal heads and skins, and attempted to tell each other’s fortunes. When the celebration was over, they re-lit their hearth fires, which they had extinguished earlier that evening, from the sacred bonfire to help protect them during the coming winter. Did you know? One quarter of all the candy sold annually in the U.S. is purchased for Halloween. By A.D. 43, the had conquered the majority of Celtic territory. In the course of the 400 years that they ruled the Celtic lands, two festivals of Roman origin were combined with the traditional Celtic celebration of Samhain. The first was Feralia, a day in late October when the Romans traditionally commemorated the passing of the dead. The second was a day to honor Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and trees. The symbol of Pomona is the apple, and the incorporation of this celebration into Samhain probably explains the tradition of bobbing for apples that is practiced today on . On May 13, A.D. 609, Pope Boniface IV dedicated the in Rome in honor of all Christian martyrs, and the Catholic feast of All Martyrs Day was established in the Western church. Pope Gregory III later expanded the festival to include all saints as well as all martyrs, and moved the observance from May 13 to November 1. By the 9th century, the influence of had spread into Celtic lands, where it gradually blended with and supplanted older rites. In A.D. 1000, the church made November 2 All Souls’ Day, a day to honor the dead. It’s widely believed today that the church was attempting to replace the Celtic festival of the dead with a related, church-sanctioned holiday. All Souls’ Day was celebrated similarly to Samhain, with big bonfires, parades and dressing up in costumes as saints, angels and . The All Saints’ Day celebration was also called All-hallows or All-hallowmas (from Middle English Alholowmesse meaning All Saints’ Day) and the night before it, the traditional night of Samhain in the Celtic religion, began to be called All-Hallows Eve and, eventually, Halloween. The celebration of Halloween was extremely limited in because of the rigid Protestant belief systems there. Halloween was much more common in and the southern colonies. As the beliefs and customs of different European ethnic groups and the American Indians meshed, a distinctly American version of Halloween began to emerge. The first celebrations included “play parties,” which were public events held to celebrate the harvest. Neighbors would share stories of the dead, tell each other’s fortunes, dance and sing. Did you know? More people are buying costumes for their pets. Americans spent nearly $500 million on costumes for their pets in 2021—more than double what they spent in 2010. Colonial Halloween festivities also featured the telling of ghost stories and mischief-making of all kinds. By the middle of the 19th century, annual autumn festivities were common, but Halloween was not yet celebrated everywhere in the country. In the second half of the 19th century, America was . These new immigrants, especially the millions of Irish fleeing the , helped to popularize the celebration of Halloween nationally. Borrowing from European traditions, Americans began to dress up in costumes and go house to house asking for food or money, a practice that eventually became today’s “trick-or-treat” tradition. Young women believed that on Halloween they could divine the name or appearance of their future husband by doing tricks with yarn, apple parings or mirrors. In the late 1800s, there was a move in America to mold Halloween into a holiday more about community and neighborly get-togethers than about ghosts, pranks and . At the turn of the century, Halloween parties for both children and adults became the most common way to celebrate the day. Parties focused on games, foods of the season and festive costumes. Parents were encouraged by newspapers and community leaders to take anything “frightening” or “grotesque” out of Halloween celebrations. Because of these efforts, Halloween lost most of its superstitious and religious overtones by the beginning of the twentieth century. By the 1920s and 1930s, Halloween had become a secular but community-centered holiday, with parades and town-wide Halloween parties as the featured entertainment. Despite the best efforts of many schools and communities, some celebrations in many communities during this time. By the 1950s, town leaders had successfully limited vandalism and Halloween had evolved into a holiday directed mainly at the young. Due to the high numbers of young children during the fifties baby boom, parties moved from town civic centers into the classroom or home, where they could be more easily accommodated. Between 1920 and 1950, the centuries-old practice of trick-or-treating was also revived. Trick-or-treating was a relatively inexpensive way for an entire community to share the Halloween celebration. In theory, families could also prevent tricks being played on them by providing the neighborhood children with small treats. Thus, a new American tradition was born, and it has continued to grow. Today, Americans spend an estimated $6 billion annually on Halloween, making it the country’s second largest commercial holiday after . Speaking of commercial success, scary have a long history of being box office hits. Classic Halloween movies include the “Halloween” franchise, based on the 1978 original film directed by John Carpenter and starring Donald Pleasance, Nick Castle, Jamie Lee Curtis and Tony Moran. In “Halloween,” a young boy named Michael Myers murders his 17-year-old sister and is committed to jail, only to escape as a teen on Halloween night and seek out his old home, and a new target. A direct sequel to the original Halloween was released in 2018, starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle. A sequel to that—Halloween Kills, the twelfth film in the Halloween franchise overall—was released in 2021. Considered a classic horror film down to its spooky soundtrack, Halloween inspired other iconic “slasher films” like “Scream,” “Nightmare on Elm Street” and “Friday the 13.” More family-friendly Halloween movies include “Hocus Pocus,” “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” “Beetlejuice” and “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.” The American Halloween tradition of trick-or-treating probably dates back to the early All Souls’ Day parades in England. During the festivities, poor citizens would beg for food and families would give them pastries called “soul cakes” in return for their promise to pray for the family’s dead relatives. The distribution of soul cakes was encouraged by the church as a way to replace the ancient practice of leaving food and wine for roaming spirits. The practice, which was referred to as “going a-souling,” was eventually taken up by children who would visit the houses in their neighborhood and be given ale, food and money. The tradition of dressing in costume for Halloween has both European and Celtic roots. Hundreds of years ago, winter was an uncertain and frightening time. Food supplies often ran low and, for the many people afraid of the dark, the short days of winter were full of constant worry. On Halloween, when it was believed that ghosts came back to the earthly world, people thought that they would encounter ghosts if they left their homes. To avoid being recognized by these ghosts, people would wear masks when they left their homes after dark so that the ghosts would mistake them for fellow spirits. On Halloween, to keep ghosts away from their houses, people would place bowls of food outside their homes to appease the ghosts and prevent them from attempting to enter. Halloween has always been a holiday filled with mystery, magic and superstition. It began as a Celtic end-of-summer festival during which people felt especially close to deceased relatives and friends. For these friendly spirits, they set places at the dinner table, left treats on doorsteps and along the side of the road and lit candles to help loved ones find their way back to the spirit world. Today’s Halloween ghosts are often depicted as more fearsome and malevolent, and our customs and superstitions are scarier too. We avoid crossing paths with , afraid that they might bring us bad luck. This idea has its roots in the , when many people believed that witches avoided detection by turning themselves into black cats. We try not to walk under ladders for the same reason. This superstition may have come from the , who believed that triangles were sacred (it also may have something to do with the fact that walking under a leaning ladder tends to be fairly unsafe). And around Halloween, especially, we try to avoid breaking mirrors, stepping on cracks in the road or spilling salt. But what about the Halloween traditions and beliefs that today’s trick-or-treaters have forgotten all about? Many of these obsolete rituals focused on the future instead of the past and the living instead of the dead. In particular, many had to do with helping young women identify their future husbands and reassuring them that they would someday—with luck, by next Halloween—be married. In 18th-century Ireland, a matchmaking cook might bury a ring in her mashed potatoes on Halloween night, hoping to bring true love to the diner who found it. In Scotland, fortune-tellers recommended that an eligible young woman name a hazelnut for each of her suitors and then toss the nuts into the fireplace. The nut that burned to ashes rather than popping or exploding, the story went, represented the girl’s future husband. (In some versions of this legend, the opposite was true: The nut that burned away symbolized a love that would not last.) Another tale had it that if a young woman ate a sugary concoction made out of walnuts, hazelnuts and nutmeg before bed on Halloween night she would dream about her future husband. Young women tossed apple-peels over their shoulders, hoping that the peels would fall on the floor in the shape of their future husbands’ initials; tried to learn about their futures by peering at egg yolks floating in a bowl of water and stood in front of mirrors in darkened rooms, holding candles and looking over their shoulders for their husbands’ faces. Other rituals were more competitive. At some Halloween parties, the first guest to find a burr on a chestnut-hunt would be the first to marry. At others, the first successful apple-bobber would be the first down the aisle. Of course, whether we’re asking for romantic advice or trying to avoid seven years of bad luck, each one of these Halloween superstitions relies on the goodwill of the very same “spirits” whose presence the early Celts felt so keenly.

Its parent organization, , is a private nonprofit conservation organization, and has one of the largest zoological membership associations in the world, with more than 250,000 member households and 130,000 child memberships, representing more than a half million people. The San Diego Zoo was a pioneer in the concept of open-air, cageless exhibits that recreate natural animal habitats. For decades, the zoo housed and successfully bred , with the largest giant panda population outside China, before the pandas were repatriated to China in 2019. With more than 4 million visitors in 2018, San Diego Zoo is the most visited zoo in the United States. Travelers have also cited it as one of the best zoos in the world. The San Diego Zoo is an accredited member of the (AZA), the (AAM), and the (WAZA). The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance also operates the . Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a zoo in San Diego? I believe I'll build one. —, after hearing a lion roar at the 1915 Panama-California Exposition The San Diego Zoo grew out of exotic animal exhibitions abandoned after the 1915 . Dr. founded the Zoological Society of San Diego, meeting October 2, 1916, which initially followed precedents set by the at the . He served as president of the society until 1941. A permanent tract of land in was set aside in August 1921; on the advice of the city attorney, it was agreed that the city would own all the animals and the zoo would manage them. The zoo began to move in the following year. In addition to the animals from the Exposition, the zoo acquired a menagerie from the defunct . financed a fence around the zoo so that it could begin charging an entrance fee to offset costs. The publication ZooNooz commenced in early 1925. Animal collector went to work as director of the San Diego Zoo on June 13, 1923, signed to a three-year contract by Wegeforth. , director of the , had recommended Buck for the job, but Buck quickly clashed with the strong-willed Wegeforth and left the zoo after three months to return to animal collecting. After several other equally short-lived zoo directors, Wegeforth appointed the zoo's bookkeeper, , to the position of executive secretary, in effect zoo director; she was given the actual title of zoo director a few years later. She served as zoo director from 1925 until 1953. For most of that time she was the only female zoo director in the world. She was succeeded as director by Dr. Charles Schroeder. The San Diego Zoo was a pioneer in building cageless exhibits. Wegeforth was determined to create moated exhibits from the start, and the first lion area at the San Diego Zoo without enclosing wires opened in 1922. Until the 1960s, admission for children under 16 was free, regardless of whether they were accompanied by a paying adult. The zoo's Center for Reproduction of (CRES) was founded in 1975 at the urging of , who became its first director. CRES was renamed the division of Conservation and Research for Endangered Species in 2005 to better reflect its mission. In 2009, CRES was significantly expanded to become the Institute for Conservation Research. The world's only albino koala in a zoological facility was born September 1, 1997, at the San Diego Zoo and was named Onya-Birri, which means ghost boy in an . The San Diego Zoo has the largest number of koalas outside of Australia. In 2014, a colony of arrived for the first time in the zoo since 1979. They have since moved into Africa Rocks when it opened in 2017. In 2016, Baba, the last on display in North America at the time, died at the zoo. In October 2020, two gorillas charged at the glass of their enclosure, damaging the outer pane. The San Diego Zoo has had a number of notable escapees through the years; the most noteworthy of them is , a who came to be known as the hairy Houdini, for his many escapes. In 1940, a managed to escape several times, earning it the nickname Terrible Trudy. In 1977, an officer for the County of San Diego, Tom Van Wagner, a previous employee of the San Diego Zoo as a guide, captured a escapee in a south central San Diego home's garage. The animal was transported to the zoo and the zoo hospital staff took possession of the capture. In March 2013, the zoo, which was hosting a private party at the time, had to initiate a when two somehow got past their barriers. They were darted with a sedative and taken to the veterinary care clinic. In 2014, a named Mundu escaped to a neighboring tree just outside its Koalafornia Australia Outback enclosure. Zookeepers lured him down the tree once the park closed that day. In early 2015, two monkeyed around outside of their Lost Forest enclosure after escaping. One of the monkeys neared a fence line off of , but was brought back to safety without injury. The zoo offers a guided tour bus that traverses 75% of the park. There is also an overhead called the Skyfari, providing an aerial view of the zoo. The Skyfari was built in 1969 by the tramway company of , Switzerland. The San Diego Zoo Skyfari is a Von Roll type 101. Exhibits at the zoo are often designed around a particular . The same exhibit may feature many different that can be found side by side in the wild, along with native plant life. Exhibits range from an African (featuring ) to the Arctic and in the summertime (featuring ). Some of the largest free-flight in existence are here, including the Owens Aviary and the Scripps Aviary. Many exhibits are natural, with invisible wires and darkened blinds (to view birds), and accessible pools and open-air moats (for large mammals). The San Diego Zoo also operates the , which displays animals in a more expansive, open setting than at the zoo. Animals are regularly exchanged between the two locations, as well as between San Diego Zoo and other zoos around the world, usually in accordance with recommendations. San Diego Zoo has one of the world's largest and most diverse animal collections; however, the number of animal species held has reduced over the past two decades from 860 to approximately 650. This comes as exhibits are redeveloped into larger, more natural displays, and as a number of animals are transitioned to San Diego Zoo Safari Park. The temperate, sunny maritime climate of California is well suited to many plants and animals. Besides an extensive collection of birds, reptiles, and mammals, it also maintains its grounds as an , with a rare plant collection. The zoo is also an accredited botanical garden; the botanical collection includes more than 700,000 exotic plants. As part of its gardening effort, some rare animal foods are grown at the zoo. For example, 40 varieties of were raised for the pandas when they were at the zoo on long-term loan from . It also maintains 18 varieties of trees to feed its . Keepers and most other employees at the San Diego Zoo are members of Union Local 481. The zoo is expected to open a new exhibit, the Sanford's Children Zoo, sometime in 2021. Monkey Trails showcases and other animals native to the tropical and semi-tropical of Asia and Africa. Opening in 2005, it replaced a decades-old area of exhibits known as Ape and Bird Mesa . These were some of the oldest animal houses still in use (at the time) at the San Diego Zoo, being built in the 1930s, with little to no change until demolition for Monkey Trails. In addition to a few small bird aviaries and a troop of apes living on a treehouse in the center of a pond, the site was centered around two square buildings; these plain structures contained many small exhibits lined up, one after another, on all four sides. One of the buildings was focused on monkeys, while the other was mainly songbirds, parrots, and tropical avian species. There had been a few efforts at landscaping these cages; however, the monkeys notably lived in bleak, prison-cell like cages. A number of Zoo members and guests left comments over the years regarding the exhibits and their lack of plant life, the (apparent) lack of enrichment for the monkeys and, mostly, the appearance of cement cell blocks as exhibits. The construction and debut of Monkey Trails and Forest Tails was undoubtedly a massive improvement, enriching for visitors but especially for the animals. Monkey Trails is home primarily to monkeys such as the , , , , , , and a group of colorful . There is also a pair of named Elgon and Mabel, who share their underwater-viewing pond with a large school of African and . On April 9, 2020 (during lockdown from ), after weeks of anticipation, Mabel gave birth to Akobi, a male calf. His birth marked the first pygmy hippo born at the zoo in nearly thirty years. They also share their enclosure with . Throughout the walking paths, visitors can also see , different species of , , , and various African freshwater ; these different animals live in a series of densely-planted - and -style exhibits, complete with thick glass panels for close-up animal encounters. In smaller and exhibits, other reptiles such as , , and can be seen. Monkey Trails utilized a newer concept for the displaying of animals; by making the exhibits two storeys high, with stairs, walkways and elevators for access, the habits of animals can be observed from ground level as well as from the treetops. Some of the highlights of Monkey Trails include several massive ( ) trees (viewable in public areas as well as in animal exhibits), , and a bog garden with , , and other . The Owens Aviary contains about 200 individual tropical birds from around 45 species, mainly from , and . The aviary is built onto the side of an approx. 60' high canyon wall, being accessible via an entry/exit at the uppermost level and another at the lower end of the aviary (essentially the canyon floor). The walkway inside the aviary connects these entryways as it ascends and descends with the natural slope. The naturally steep location proves to be perfect for the exhibit's waterfall, which cascades downhill through the aviary before splashing down into a large pond. The ambient white noise of the waterfall is quite noticeable, but relaxing and tranquil, rather than very loud. The waterfall churns up mist, and a cool steam fills the aviary with ambient humidity; additionally, the outside of the structure is painted a dark green color, which helps to block any excess sunlight from penetrating inside. This further gives visitors the feeling of walking through a lush, dense jungle. The entire aviary is lushly landscaped and thick with palms, ficus, species (such as and ), sp., and many more varieties. The varied collection of bird life includes the , , , , , , , , the , , the , and pheasants. The Scripps Aviary was built in 1923 and is home to many colorful birds from Africa such as the , , , , , , , , , , , and . The Parker Aviary houses various birds from South America including , , , , , , , and . It is situated next to a complex of 20 smaller aviaries previously known as Wings of Australasia, exhibiting tropical birds from Southeast Asia and the Pacific. San Diego Zoo has the largest collection of birds in North America. Together the zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park hold America's most diverse collection of hornbills, with 15 species displayed in 2014. As of April 2019, the exhibit is not in operation. The zone was previously called Giant Panda Research Station. The pandas were repatriated to after successfully serving the larger conservation effort for pandas. In the past, the San Diego Zoo was one of four zoos in the U.S. which had on display, and was the most successful in terms of panda reproduction. The first two giant panda cubs in to have been born in the U.S. and survive into adulthood— (female, born to and ) and (male, born to Bai Yun and )—were born at the San Diego Zoo, in 1999 and 2003, respectively. After that, three more giant panda cubs— and (both females) and (male) —were born to the resident giant panda parents Bai Yun and Gao Gao. (meaning little gift), was born on July 29, 2012, and was let outside for visitors to see on January 9, 2013. All of the cubs have since been sent back to China to participate in the breeding program there. In addition to being able to view this rare animal species, the nearby Giant Panda Discovery Center had interactive exhibits that let the visitor experience firsthand what the animals smell and sound like. Since the closing of Panda Trek, there are now exhibits of other Chinese animals, including , , , and an exhibit comparing several types of . There is also a feline area, featuring the critically endangered and . The leopards' enclosures are located on both sides of the public walkway, and are connected with elevated climbing tunnels which arch over visitors at a height of about 20'. In addition to perfect photo opportunities, this exhibit provides stimulating enrichment for the leopards, who can be seen patrolling the tunnels and people-watching from above.

It employs numerous professional geneticists, cytologists, and veterinarians and maintains a facility for rare sperm and eggs called the . The San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research is the largest zoo-based multidisciplinary research effort in the world. Based at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for Conservation Research adjacent to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, more than 200 dedicated scientists carry out research vital to the conservation of animals, plants, and habitats, locally and internationally. Zoo Corps is a volunteer program at the San Diego Zoo that enlists high school students to teach guests at the zoo about the animals they are seeing and their place in the ecosystem. It enrolls students between 13 and 17 years of age. The goals are to promote about animals and , and to help the students develop their ability to speak in public. The program runs year round in two sessions, one from May through November and one from January through May. Members of the Zoo Corps are expected to volunteer at least once a month. The program utilizes a series of Kits, which are set on tables throughout the zoo. The kits contain objects that can be used to explain why an animal is endangered or to shed light on the animal's lifestyle. The four kits are Backyard Habitats, Saving Species, Animal Care, and Sustainability. Local architect designed the original buildings, cages and animal grottos and later in 1926, the -style research hospital, for which Gill received an Honor Award from the San Diego Chapter of the . Gill also designed a bird cage at the zoo in 1937, then the largest bird cage in the world.

        "html_text": "Explore the wildlife you will encounter on a visit to the San Diego Zoo. Amur leopards love climbing, exploring, and playing with new things, and have a keen appreciation for scents. A member of the boa family, South America’s green anaconda is the heaviest snake in the world. You'll find quite a few botanical wonders from Down Under by the koalas and our other Australian and New Zealand animals. Sometimes called the pig deer because of adult males' unusual tusks, babirusas live in wetlands and swamps within the rainforests of Indonesia's islands of Sulawesi, Togian, Sula, and Buru. The aptly named bee-eater bird is a skilled hunter, capable of catching a bee in flight, then heading to a tree branch to stun it and remove the stinger before eating it. Male black-headed weavers build intricate hanging nests from strips of leaves, in hopes of attracting a female. Bonobos are quite possibly the most intelligent primates on Earth (other than us, of course!)—and the San Diego Zoo was one of the first zoos to bring attention to these highly endangered primates. There are about 2,000 species of bromeliads, a rainforest plant—all of which are native to the Americas except one African species. Most bromeliads collect a pool of water in their centers and flower above the cup. When they fly, California condors are a sight to behold. Their huge wings catch thermal air currents that rise up as the sun heats the ground—and with those wings, they can stay aloft for hours. Camels can travel as fast as horses, but can also endure legendary periods of time without food or water. Meet the capybara, the largest rodent in the world. Cheetahs are the world's fastest land animal—capable of reaching speeds up to 70 miles per hour! From nose to tail, belly to back, hard scales protect this petite alligator. Even their eyelids have bony plates under the skin! Named for its cloud-like spots, the clouded leopard is a unique genus of cat and not just a type of leopard. Dung beetles come in a variety of colors, from dull and glossy black to metallic green and red. Ancient Egyptians thought very highly of the dung beetle, also known as the scarab. African elephants have very large ears that are shaped like the continent of Africa, while Asian elephants have smaller ears. You can see both species at Elephant Odyssey! Follow the steps that lead down into Fern Canyon, a peaceful rainforest refuge that's perfect for a meandering stroll. Found only on the forested island habitat of Madagascar, fossas may look a little like both cats and dogs, but they are actually more closely related to the mongoose. Several of our Galápagos tortoises have been with us since 1928, making them the oldest residents in the Zoo. We estimate their age to be well over 100. Found only in the mountains of Ethiopia, geladas are considered the most terrestrial primate species, and they are the only primate with a diet made up mostly of grasses. This family includes gingers, bananas, birds of paradise, heliconia, and cannas. Giraffes are distinguished by their coat patterns, and by where they live in Africa. At the Zoo's Urban Jungle, you can see Masai giraffes. The Zoo's horticultural treasures are very important for our gorillas' health and contentment. The lush vegetation of Gorilla Tropics, combined with a variety of browse to snack on and play with, has led to a healthy family life for our gorilla troop. Brown bears in interior North America are known as grizzly bears, because their brown fur is tipped with white or tan; the word grizzly means sprinkled or streaked with gray. Hamadryas baboons can scale sheer cliff faces to reach their favorite craggy ledges—and there is constant activity as they vocalize, groom each other, bound into trees, and chase each other around. The harpy eagle is legendary, although few people have seen one in the wild. Fortunately, you can view one here at the Zoo! At this habitat showcasing Hawaiian plants, you'll discover the many treasures that exist in the flora of the Hawaiian Islands. With their eyes, ears, and nostrils on the top of the head, hippos can hear, see, and breathe while most of their body is underwater. Jaguars are built for life in the tropical rainforest, with muscular limbs and large paws to climb trees, pad along the forest floor, and even swim in rivers and streams. The largest venomous snake in the world, the king cobra has special muscles and ribs in its neck that spread out to form a hood when it feels threatened. Standing less than 2 feet tall at the shoulder, klipspringers can jump 10 to 15 feet straight up in the air! The San Diego Zoo has the largest koala colony—as well as the most successful koala breeding program—outside of Australia. There are over 3,000 lizard species, but the Komodo dragon wins the prize for being the largest living lizard in the world! Known as the bushman’s alarm clock, a laughing kookaburra vocalizes in its family group at dawn and dusk—with a loud call that sounds like a variety of trills, chortles, belly laughs, and hoots. Found in only one area on Earth—Madagascar and the nearby Comoro Islands—lemurs are considered the world’s most endangered group of mammals. Lions are famous for their sonorous roar but have other forms of communication as well, mostly used to mark territory. They spread their scent by rubbing their muzzle on tufts of grass or shrubs, and they rake the earth with their hind paws. Mang Mountain pit vipers are strikingly beautiful snakes with green scales to help them blend into their bamboo habitat. Meerkats live in underground burrows in a group—up to 30 individuals—called a gang or a mob, and they spend much of their time grooming and playing together to keep the family as a tight unit. San Diego Zoo guests can encounter some of the most rare and endangered monkeys on Earth in the Zoo’s Lost Forest. Mountain lions are the stealthiest of cats, hunting prey two to three times their own size. Capable of reaching speeds of 15 miles per hour when swimming after prey (schooling fish, like sardines and anchovies), penguins also have staying power—they can remain underwater for more than two minutes! Polar bears are right at home at the San Diego Zoo's Conrad Prebys Polar Bear Plunge, where every day is an Arctic summer day. At first glance, the pygmy hippo looks like a mini version of its larger relative, the river or common hippopotamus. But the pygmy hippo is much less aquatic than its cousin. That famous rattle at the end of a rattlesnake’s tail is made of interlocking rings, or segments of keratin—the same material our fingernails are made of. The red panda’s reddish coat and white face mask offer camouflage among the red moss and white lichen that cover the trees of its bamboo forest home. In most deer species, only the males grow antlers. But reindeer are the exception: both males and females grow these bony structures, but at different times of the year! Reptile Mesa has all kinds of exotic-looking plants (including, appropriately, dragon trees!) from all kinds of exotic locations. Rhinos may look tough, but their skin is actually quite sensitive. That's why they like to wallow in mud—it puts a layer between their skin and the sun, and insects. Long limbs give servals the ability to leap nine feet—straight up—to catch birds in midair, or reach deep into a rodent burrow to pull out prey. Snow leopards live in Asia at very high elevations, where there are steep cliffs. The wild goats and sheep they prey on are quite nimble at leaping from rock to rock—and so are snow leopards! Sun bears, named for the golden crescent on their chest, are extremely agile tree climbers and make excellent use of their habitat's climbing structures. With its cascading waterfalls, bubbling streams, thousands of exotic plants, and Indochinese animals, Sun Bear Forest® may be the closest you'll come to experiencing a southeast Asian rainforest in Southern California. Gold-colored takins seem to have the horns of a wildebeest, the nose of a moose, and the body of a bison! But takins are related to sheep and wild goats. Most closely related to horses and rhinos, tapirs have a nose and upper lip combined into a flexible snout like an elephant’s trunk, which they use to reach and pull plant material into their mouth. When a group of Tasmanian devils feeds together, harsh screeching and spine-chilling screams can often be heard—which may have led to their unusual name. There's almost always something blooming among the Terrace Lagoon's beautiful collection of bamboo, Asian pines, and flowering trees and shrubs. A simulation of a tropical Asian rainforest, Tiger Trail features plants watered with a custom, high-tech misting system that has allowed them to grow to the point where you may truly feel like you're walking into a jungle. Turtles spend most of their life in the water; terrapins spend time both on land and in water, but always live near water, along rivers, ponds, and lakes. At the Zoo, guests can occasionally see our two-toed sloth wildlife ambassadors making special appearances. These vocal and clever monkeys communicate with calls as well as body language. The endangered Grevy's zebra is the largest of the three zebra species. It can weigh almost 1,000 pounds. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance is a 501(c)(3) organization "

        "html_text": " By: Author Posted on Last updated: March 21, 2023 Pennsylvania, the Keystone State, was one of the 13 original colonies of America. It was named by King James II by combining the Latin word for “woodland”, “Sylvania”, and the surname of Admiral Sir William Penn. It achieved statehood in 1787 and is a notable area to visit for history buffs thanks to its many significant roles in time. It is here that the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Liberty Bell first tolled, and it is also home to sites that were central in the American Revolutionary War and American Civil War. Naturally, all this history means that Pennsylvania is packed with exciting attractions. From sprawling gardens to ornate feats of architecture and from historical buildings and museums to art galleries and institutes, there’s no shortage of places that you can visit. There’s even a healthy mix of cheap and free things to do. So, where to first? To help you decide, here is our travel guide for 50 fun things to do and places to visit in Pennsylvania! MISHELLA / Shutterstock The is an eerie structure that resembles a castle but held a very different purpose. An amalgamation of the old and the new, it is a prison and boasts stone construction, fortress-like archways and corridors, industrial-style simplistic watchtowers, and formerly “hi-tech” fixings. It was built in the year 1829 and closed in 1971, and as of its last days, it was one of America’s leading facilities of its kind. Before the creation of the Eastern State Penitentiary, most prisons had actually been akin to commercial spots. There was little order in them, with corrupt officers, prostitutes, lots of alcohol, and a high rate of prisoner death before sentencing. The Eastern State Penitentiary was designed to combat these “trends”, made by the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons. The building was one of the world’s most expensive buildings in its time, with an $800,000 price tag. In its day, the Eastern State Penitentiary was very much a technological marvel. It had private toilets for prisoners before the President had more than a chamber pot, and there were private exercise spaces, three filling and large daily meals, and beautiful skylights in rooms. It sounded like a paradise, but that was only on the surface. Prisoners were not allowed to interact with any other prisoners or speak to any guards. They exercised, ate, and read the only allowed book – the Bible – alone. Guards wore shoe covers to keep the entire complex incredibly quiet, creating complete silence and solitude. The hopeless solitary confinement of the Eastern State Penitentiary would drive many of its prisoners insane. Its separate prison system and overcrowding would eventually lead to this confinement system being overturned, returning to the “New York System” of incarceration, where social interaction was allowed once more. Its modernity made it ideal for housing those such as Al Capone (who received a lavish cell) and Willie Sutton. The Eastern State Penitentiary closed down in 1971 and was narrowly saved for destruction following years of abandonment. It reopened in 1994 and has become one of Pennsylvania’s famous landmarks, providing tours to interested visitors. Whether for the historical value, photography opportunities, or macabre exploration, it’s one of the things to do in Pennsylvania you shouldn’t miss. Address: 2027 Fairmount Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19130, United States Pamela Brick / Shutterstock Andy Warhol, the one-and-only famous artist who was a prominent influence in the world of Pop Art, was born in , Pennsylvania. The pays tribute to his long and illustrious career and life, spanning from his birth to his latter years, up until his passing in 1987. It is the largest in the country that is dedicated to a single artist. At the Andy Warhol Museum, you’ll gain insight into the artist and his many pieces, including famous works like Tomato Soup Cans and his portraits of Elvis and Marilyn. Exhibits are dedicated to his life and times. The museum covers seven floors and houses a large permanent collection featuring his works and an archive packed with relevant documents to the great artist. Don’t forget to pop into the Factory portion of the Andy Warhol Museum. Here, you’ll get to learn and try some of Warhol’s own personal techniques for his art. Art educators lead the way, allowing you to try making acetate collages, silk screenings, and drawings with blotted lines. Concerts, film screenings, performances, live entertainment, and lectures are also held here. For art lovers and curious tourists alike, this is one of Pennsylvania’s top 10 hotspots. Address: 117 Sandusky St, Pittsburgh, PA 15212, United States Sean Pavone / Shutterstock ‘s unique name is a product of its actual appearance. Known also as the Kaufmann Residence, it is chiefly recognized as one of the finest private homes designed by the renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright – and one of his best designs overall! It was built in 1935 and features a structure that protrudes over a waterfall in Pennsylvania’s Fayette County, where it sits on Bear Run in the Steward Township as one of the most loved Pennsylvania attractions and . Fallingwater cost $155,000 to build. It mixes the wonders of the natural world with delightful organic architecture in order to create a seamless harmony between the house and the environment surrounding it. Inside, furnishings are made from walnut wood that cost $4,500 in total. As soon as it was built, Fallingwater was an architectural icon and was featured in many publications and magazines. In 1966, it was determined a National Historic Landmark, and in 1991, it was considered the greatest work of American architecture by the American Institute of Architecture. For a time, the gorgeous Fallingwater home was lived in by the Kauffman family as their summer home. But the ceiling had over 50 different leaks which Wright refused to fix, telling them to simply put a bucket under the leaks – which now, as an open public attraction since 1964, is advice that those who manage the home follow! The home is the only major work by Wright that is open for the public, and it boasts many original features and components. The Kauffmans filled Fallingwater with art pieces and collections of artifacts that remain on display for visitors till now. Folk crafts, sculptures, and even designer furniture make up the overall aesthetic. You’ll find a cast-iron Buddha head dating as far back as 906, an 8th-century sculpture of Parvati the Hindu fertility goddess, a Madonna from 1420 of Austrian-Bohemian style, unique ceramics and sculptures, and collections of art by Picasso and Diego Rivera. Works from Mexico, Africa, and other cultures adorn the house, providing many sights to see on your visit. Address: 1491 Mill Run Rd, Mill Run, PA 15464, United States George Sheldon / Shutterstock is a fun amusement park packed with activities that will amuse people of all ages. It is located in the famous Pennsylvania town of , which, as its name may suggest, is very closely related to the popular Hershey’s brand of chocolate. Spanning 90 acres, Hersheypark is the main attraction of the town. It was originally built as a recreational site for works of Hershey’s in 1906, but it eventually expanded – and continues to expand! Among the things to see and do in Hersheypark are a train, Ferris wheel, carousel, roller coasters, a water park, bumper cars, a zoo, an observation tower, midway games, video arcades, and an amphitheater with live entertainment acts. There are over 70 total attractions here as well as restaurants catering to people of all preferences. For an exciting day in Pennsylvania, you can’t go wrong with Hersheypark! Address: 100 Hersheypark Dr, Hershey, PA 17033, United States Jon Bilous / Shutterstock The is a natural choice for what to do in the state. Spanning 45 acres of land, it is home to multiple tourist destinations within as well as several active government buildings. It features a huge dome styled after the Cathedral of St. Peter in Rome, which was built here in 1906 and rests on top of the main complex, where it weighs 52 million pounds. The Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex’s main building is made from granite and features a huge part of bronze double doors. Tours inside are available but have to be pre-scheduled. The gorgeous architecture of the whole area is worth seeing and exploring, and the grounds house many memorials and museums, including the state’s War Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Soldier’s Grove Quadrangle. Address: 501 N 3rd St, Harrisburg, PA 17120, United States Zack Frank / Shutterstock The in Pennsylvania is the site where, in 1863, the American Civil War’s Battle of took place, taking 51,000 lives approximately in its three-day rage. Today, it is adamant that visitors never forget those lives, with monuments and markers throughout the location, totaling hundreds, to provide educational information to guests. Among the best spots to check out at the Gettysburg National Military Park are Cemetery Ridge, where Union lines stood on the last two days, Oak Ridge, which is where the first day’s battle occurred, and Seminary Ridge, where Confederate lines stood on the last two days. You can also head to the Park Museum and Visitor Center, where you can view one of America’s largest collection of Civil War weapons, uniforms, and personal items in the Rosensteel collection. There are also programs, events, horseback trails, and reenactments that make this one of the most interesting places to visit in PA for history lovers. Address: 1195 Baltimore Pike, Gettysburg, PA 17325, United States Mütter Museum is situated within the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is definitely among the state’s most fascinating places to visit. It is a medical museum that opened in 1858 and is a haven of strange, wondrous, curious, and stomach-turning medical displays, body parts, anatomical oddities, and other things weird and gory. There are many fun things you’ll spot on display at the Mütter Museum, though most of them are more bizarrely fascinating. For example, there are the bones of Harry Eastlack, who passed away due to a very rare disorder called Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva. The disorder caused his bones to fuse together when his body’s soft connective tissue ossified, freezing him in an unmoving state. Another example is the Soap Lady, which is a corpse from the 1800s that was exhumed due to the very weird waxy substance that was produced when it started decomposing. There is also the skeleton of North America’s tallest man to ever live, preserved human fetuses, a collection of 2,000 items removed from the throats of patients from the Chevalier Jackson Foreign Body Collection, extremely detailed wax models, conjoined twin skeletons, a piece from the vertebra of John Wilkes Booth, and a plaster cast of famous Siamese Twins Eng and Chang Bunker. But the most loved part of the Mütter Museum is a collection of 46 microscope slides that each contain silvers from Albert Einstein’s brain. Einstein had wanted to be cremated, but pathologist Thomas Harvey saved his brain from the ashes. After a long fight to keep it, scientists were able to examine it. In the 1980s, it became clear that Einstein’s brain had a unique structure that may have contributed to or been a result of his genius. Now, these slides are, in themselves, one of the state’s biggest tourist draws. Address: 19 S 22nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19103, United States Delmas Lehman / Shutterstock of Pennsylvania are a symbol of the sacrifices, successes, suffering, and ultimate victory of the American Revolutionary War. It is here that the Continental Army bundled up for the winter of 1777 to 1778, where they lived in crude cabins made of logs after British troops destroyed their center for supplies. Soldiers here were casualties, with 2,000 or so of them struggling from poor conditions, hunger, and disease. Despite the wind chills, they lived, rested, and tried to survive from December to June. George Washington’s own house remains here, available to tour, a reminiscent glimpse into the past. The Valley Forge National Historic Park spans 3,500 acres and boasts multiple tours, a National Memorial Arch, plenty of recreational trails and spaces, and facilities like restrooms and a canteen. For locals and tourists alike, exploring and sightseeing here is one of the lovely things to do in PA. Address: 1400 N Outer Line Dr, King of Prussia, PA 19406, United States ismailbayram / Shutterstock is a large complex in Schenley Park of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It spans 15 acres and is a part of the National Register of Historic Places, with 14 rooms within the main conservatory building. The space was donated to Pittsburgh in 1893 by Henry Phipps, a real estate and steel magnate who built it as a present for the city. The Phipps Conservatory’s main goal is to educate guests and provide a fun experience for all visitors. It boasts 23 gardens such as the rooftop edible garden, children’s garden, and Japanese garden, a Center for Sustainable Landscapes, and of course, the conservatory glasshouse, made in a Victorian style. The 14 rooms of the Phipps Conservatory glasshouse are packed with all sorts of exotic plants. This includes spices, orchids, palm trees, tropical fruits, ferns, bonsai, and even a Desert Room boasting cacti and a Tropical Forest Conservatory that feels like it’s a world away from the state. Themed flower shows, special events, and a beautiful chandelier all add to the experience, making this one of the chief places to visit in Pennsylvania for nature-lovers! Address: 1 Schenley Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States Samuel Borges Photography / Shutterstock The is home to one of the country’s best and biggest art collections, and it’s also iconic in Pennsylvania thanks to its front steps’ feature in the Rocky movies. More than 227,000 pieces of art rest here, from American to European to Asian art, making it one of the world’s most important artistic institutions. Permanent collections at the Philadelphia Museum of Art include very varied works of art, including costumes, Asian ceramics, decorative arts, American colonial furniture, paintings, photographs, fashion, prints, armor, drawings, textiles, and a sculpture garden outdoors. Great artists such as Cézanne, Dali, Chagall, Picasso, Rembrandt, Monet, Manet, Renoir, Van Gogh, and Matisse have works here. As one of Pennsylvania’s most attractive points of interest for art aficionados, you’ll be pleased to know that the Philadelphia Museum of Art features work from the times of French Impressionism, the Renaissance, the Middle Ages, and even the present day. Don’t miss a trip here if you can help it! Address: 2600 Benjamin Franklin Pkwy, Philadelphia, PA 19130, United States Travel Bug / Shutterstock The sits between two prestigious buildings: the Free Library of Philadelphia and the aforementioned Philadelphia Museum of Art, yet another one of this Pennsylvania city’s tourist places. It is much more specific than the larger Museum of Art, focused only on the exhibition of the works of sculptor Auguste Rodin. Opened in 1929, it is the biggest collection of his works outside of Paris and was a gift from a philanthropist named Jules Mastbaum. The Rodin Museum is a beautifully designed building in the Beaux-Arts style, fringed all around by formal French gardens that hold more fun and insightful sculptures by Rodin. The sculpture right outside of the museum is the incredibly famous work, The Thinker, and visiting to see that in itself is one of the things to do in Pennsylvania. Inside the Rodin Museum, close to 150 different sculptures representing many different points of Rodin’s life and career are on display. This includes bronzes, plasters, marbles, prints, and even works in progress. The museum is managed by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and is a must-see for fans and curious tourists alike. Address: 2151 Benjamin Franklin Pkwy, Philadelphia, PA 19130, United States Jordan Molz / Shutterstock has a long history and was almost a forgotten, destroyed portion of Pennsylvania, but following some rescuing, it has become one of Southwest ‘s best unusual spots for sightseeing. The cemetery originally opened in 1855, boasting gothic mausoleums, a regal and ornate entrance in a Romanesque brick style, and an eventual expansion of 400 acres of land to become the biggest burial site in Pennsylvania. Interestingly, no one actually owns the cemetery, which is part of why it became abandoned and forgotten. For a time, it seemed that Mount Moriah Cemetery would simply be reclaimed by nature, as the headstones and monuments within fell and overgrowth overtook even the wealthiest Victorian graves. That’s when the Friends Of Mount Moriah, a local non-profit group, stepped in to help. With years of work, more than half of the cemetery has been cleared up and is reopened for eager eyes and fun, if sobering, exploration. Address: 6201 Kingsessing Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19142, United States f11photo / Shutterstock One of the biggest and most known Pennsylvania attractions is probably and its accompanying Liberty Bell. An incredibly historic location, it is here in the park that the Declaration of Independence was signed, and the table that George Washington used is still on-site for visitors to ogle. It is also a World Heritage Site. The central feature of Independence National Historical Park is Independence Hall, a Georgian building of red brick available for ranger-led tours. The structure was Pennsylvania’s first legislative building and was built in 1763. Across the street, the Liberty Bell Center and its famous crack rest, two tons in weight, after its ringing in 1776 to celebrate Independence. Beyond there, you’ll find Independence Mall, which extends north and has since 1948. It lays out trails to Carpenter’s Hall, Old City Hall, and Congress Hall, among other historic buildings lining the cobblestone roads. Address: Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States Vivvi Smak / Shutterstock If you’re choosing the best things to see in the state of Pennsylvania, you simply must take in the stunning site seeing opportunity that is . The gardens are a nonprofit group, a folk ark center, and a gallery for the works of Isaiah Zagar, a famous mosaicist, on the site of his biggest public installation of art. In the late 1960s, Zagar began focusing his efforts on beautifying the neighborhood of South Street after moving here with his wife. The couple helped revive the area by buying and refurbishing buildings that were falling apart, using vibrant mosaics to color the walls and bring life to them. The first building they did this with was the Eyes Gallery, which remains open and doing well now. Zagar’s work on the Magic Gardens began in 1994, using a vacant lot that was close to his studio. For 14 years, he excavated grottos and tunnels, sculptured walls in layers, added grouting and tiling and perfected 3,000 square feet of space. A mix of found objects, community contributions, and more cover half a block in Pennsylvania with bright hues, textures, and tiles of all sorts. The labyrinth of the gardens is packed with sculptures, handmade art, and other objects, and it’s no wonder that the Magic Gardens are not a permanent art institution hosting live entertainment and public workshops run by the man himself, Zagar! Address: 1020 South St, Philadelphia, PA 19147, United States , , via Wikimedia Commons The sits in Fairmount Park of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of the unusual places to see in one of the most . It is an enhanced cave of sorts, fitted into a hillside, its one entrance marked by a stone frame. It is here that it is thought that the first mystic cult in America lived in the 17th century. Supposedly, the cave was settled by Johannes Kelpius, a scholar and mystic, with his 40 all-male followers in 1694. He believed that the world would come to an end that year due to his interpretation of the Book of Revelation. They were known as The Society of the Woman of the Wilderness, after a passage in Revelation where a woman ran to hide from the end of the world in the wilderness. They were also called, simply, the Hermits of the Wissahickon, which lends itself to the name of the area: Hermit’s Glen, marked in present-day Pennsylvania by the road Hermit Lane. In the Cave of Kelpius, the group practiced astronomy and used the space to meet and as an observatory. They remained there even after the world did not end, and they continued to study the skies, make music and art, and even help the community. In 1708, Kelpius died, and the group largely disbanded, with many remaining in the area to serve as lawyers and doctors. The cave is largely demolished now, with only the stone structure outside remaining, but it’s a fascinating visit steeped in history. Address: 777-795 Hermit Ln, Philadelphia, PA 19128, United States woodsnorthphoto / Shutterstock The was founded in 1896 by the titular Andrew Carnegie, an industrialist and local of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was here that housed the scientists that discovered the first fossils of the Diplodocus carnegii dinosaur. It’s a fun spot and one of the coolest places to visit in PA with family. Throughout the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, you’ll see exhibits of minerals, fossils, gems, animals, and more. The museum’s pride is housing the planet’s biggest Jurassic dinosaur collection, including the first Tyrannosaurus rex specimen and the only juvenile Apatosaurus fossils. While dinosaurs are the main draw, topics such as archeology, herpetology, and zoology are also covered. Address: 4400 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States Zachary Chung Pun / Shutterstock The sits close to the base of Pennsylvania’s Schuylkill River. It is a hidden gem among tourist attractions, but one of the country’s best examples of genuine Japanese design from centuries ago. The name “Shofuso” roughly means “Pine Breeze Villa” and was made as part of a House in the Garden exhibit for the Museum of Modern Art. The Shofuso Japanese House and Garden was made by Junzō Yoshimura, an architect, who built it in Japan in 1953. It was sent and assembled in the following year, given to America as a gift from Japan. For a while, the Museum of Modern Art held onto it, and then the exhibition closed and it was moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1958. The house of the Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is designed following shoin-zukuri architecture and proportions. It is meant to resemble a temple guest house, boasting a kitchen, tea room, and bath and topped with a roof of hinoki bark that had to be specially requested from the National Forestry Agency of Japan. The gardens, on the other hand, are host to a tea garden, courtyard garden, koi pond, and a little island. Vandalism and abandonment left the Shofuso Japanese House and Garden in disrepair for years. Famous Japanese painter Hiroshi Senju helped refurbish it in 2007, donating 20 murals to the grounds. Now, the place is very much perked up, and it’s one of the greatest tourist attractions in the state. Address: Lansdowne Dr &, Horticultural Dr, Philadelphia, PA 19131, United States Sean Pavone / Shutterstock is a public market in the downtown area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Since 1893, it has housed more than a hundred merchants operating out of the former train shed of Reading Terminal, and it became a National Historic Landmark in 1995. Visiting Reading Terminal Market is one of the top things to do in PA, especially if you’re looking to experience local life on a deeper level. Baked goods, home-cooked meals, cultural food, crafts, artisanal cheese, ice cream, homemade chocolate, books and cookbooks, canned preserves, meats and fish, fresh produce, kitchen supplies, candy, clothing, jewelry, and more are all sold here on an almost daily basis. Address: 51 N 12th St, Philadelphia, PA 19107, United States Fernando Garcia Esteban / Shutterstock The are near to each other and are closely related, making them the best places to visit in Pennsylvania back-to-back. Fonthill Castle was the home of Henry Chapman Mercer, a famous collector, tile maker, and archaeologist. He planned the house completely, from the exterior to each interior room, which he sketched and imagined himself. Fonthill Castle was finished in 1912 and is made completely from poured concrete, somehow ornate and somehow impossible to categorize from an architectural standpoint. The use of pure concrete was due to Mercer’s fear of fires, which developed after he lost some medieval armor that he was storing while building the museum to the Great Boston Fire. People made fun of him – but he demonstrated the effectiveness of such construction by building a huge bonfire on an upper terrace and allowing it to rage, high enough for all residents of the surrounding Doylestown to see. Mercer was a little “mad”, though – or at least extremely eccentric, especially for the surrounding Pennsylvania town. Despite his personal loathing for “false taste” and “ugliness”, Fonthill Castle is extremely strangely built and reflects a style and reason that only he truly understands. 32 stairs, 8 bedrooms, roof pitch, vaulted ceilings, and unpainted walls… it makes for quite the sight! Meanwhile, Mercer Museum nearby houses all sorts of “average American” tools used from the 18th to 19th centuries. Watchmakers’ gears, tortoiseshell comb makers’ supplies, whalers’ boats, butchers’ instruments, a fake vampire hunting kit, and more. The museum is also made from pure concrete and houses 55 exhibit rooms that each concentrate on different trades from pre-industrial times, such as farming, metalsmithing, milling, woodworking, and sewing tools.

        "html_text": " By: Author Posted on Last updated: March 21, 2023 Pennsylvania, the Keystone State, was one of the 13 original colonies of America. It was named by King James II by combining the Latin word for “woodland”, “Sylvania”, and the surname of Admiral Sir William Penn. It achieved statehood in 1787 and is a notable area to visit for history buffs thanks to its many significant roles in time. It is here that the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Liberty Bell first tolled, and it is also home to sites that were central in the American Revolutionary War and American Civil War. Naturally, all this history means that Pennsylvania is packed with exciting attractions. From sprawling gardens to ornate feats of architecture and from historical buildings and museums to art galleries and institutes, there’s no shortage of places that you can visit. There’s even a healthy mix of cheap and free things to do. So, where to first? To help you decide, here is our travel guide for 50 fun things to do and places to visit in Pennsylvania! MISHELLA / Shutterstock The is an eerie structure that resembles a castle but held a very different purpose. An amalgamation of the old and the new, it is a prison and boasts stone construction, fortress-like archways and corridors, industrial-style simplistic watchtowers, and formerly “hi-tech” fixings. It was built in the year 1829 and closed in 1971, and as of its last days, it was one of America’s leading facilities of its kind. Before the creation of the Eastern State Penitentiary, most prisons had actually been akin to commercial spots. There was little order in them, with corrupt officers, prostitutes, lots of alcohol, and a high rate of prisoner death before sentencing. The Eastern State Penitentiary was designed to combat these “trends”, made by the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons. The building was one of the world’s most expensive buildings in its time, with an $800,000 price tag. In its day, the Eastern State Penitentiary was very much a technological marvel. It had private toilets for prisoners before the President had more than a chamber pot, and there were private exercise spaces, three filling and large daily meals, and beautiful skylights in rooms. It sounded like a paradise, but that was only on the surface. Prisoners were not allowed to interact with any other prisoners or speak to any guards. They exercised, ate, and read the only allowed book – the Bible – alone. Guards wore shoe covers to keep the entire complex incredibly quiet, creating complete silence and solitude. The hopeless solitary confinement of the Eastern State Penitentiary would drive many of its prisoners insane. Its separate prison system and overcrowding would eventually lead to this confinement system being overturned, returning to the “New York System” of incarceration, where social interaction was allowed once more. Its modernity made it ideal for housing those such as Al Capone (who received a lavish cell) and Willie Sutton. The Eastern State Penitentiary closed down in 1971 and was narrowly saved for destruction following years of abandonment. It reopened in 1994 and has become one of Pennsylvania’s famous landmarks, providing tours to interested visitors. Whether for the historical value, photography opportunities, or macabre exploration, it’s one of the things to do in Pennsylvania you shouldn’t miss.

In 1966, it was determined a National Historic Landmark, and in 1991, it was considered the greatest work of American architecture by the American Institute of Architecture. For a time, the gorgeous Fallingwater home was lived in by the Kauffman family as their summer home. But the ceiling had over 50 different leaks which Wright refused to fix, telling them to simply put a bucket under the leaks – which now, as an open public attraction since 1964, is advice that those who manage the home follow! The home is the only major work by Wright that is open for the public, and it boasts many original features and components. The Kauffmans filled Fallingwater with art pieces and collections of artifacts that remain on display for visitors till now. Folk crafts, sculptures, and even designer furniture make up the overall aesthetic.

It is a medical museum that opened in 1858 and is a haven of strange, wondrous, curious, and stomach-turning medical displays, body parts, anatomical oddities, and other things weird and gory. There are many fun things you’ll spot on display at the Mütter Museum, though most of them are more bizarrely fascinating. For example, there are the bones of Harry Eastlack, who passed away due to a very rare disorder called Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva. The disorder caused his bones to fuse together when his body’s soft connective tissue ossified, freezing him in an unmoving state. Another example is the Soap Lady, which is a corpse from the 1800s that was exhumed due to the very weird waxy substance that was produced when it started decomposing. There is also the skeleton of North America’s tallest man to ever live, preserved human fetuses, a collection of 2,000 items removed from the throats of patients from the Chevalier Jackson Foreign Body Collection, extremely detailed wax models, conjoined twin skeletons, a piece from the vertebra of John Wilkes Booth, and a plaster cast of famous Siamese Twins Eng and Chang Bunker. But the most loved part of the Mütter Museum is a collection of 46 microscope slides that each contain silvers from Albert Einstein’s brain. Einstein had wanted to be cremated, but pathologist Thomas Harvey saved his brain from the ashes. After a long fight to keep it, scientists were able to examine it. In the 1980s, it became clear that Einstein’s brain had a unique structure that may have contributed to or been a result of his genius. Now, these slides are, in themselves, one of the state’s biggest tourist draws.

It is here that the Continental Army bundled up for the winter of 1777 to 1778, where they lived in crude cabins made of logs after British troops destroyed their center for supplies. Soldiers here were casualties, with 2,000 or so of them struggling from poor conditions, hunger, and disease. Despite the wind chills, they lived, rested, and tried to survive from December to June.

It is much more specific than the larger Museum of Art, focused only on the exhibition of the works of sculptor Auguste Rodin. Opened in 1929, it is the biggest collection of his works outside of Paris and was a gift from a philanthropist named Jules Mastbaum. The Rodin Museum is a beautifully designed building in the Beaux-Arts style, fringed all around by formal French gardens that hold more fun and insightful sculptures by Rodin. The sculpture right outside of the museum is the incredibly famous work, The Thinker, and visiting to see that in itself is one of the things to do in Pennsylvania. Inside the Rodin Museum, close to 150 different sculptures representing many different points of Rodin’s life and career are on display. This includes bronzes, plasters, marbles, prints, and even works in progress. The museum is managed by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and is a must-see for fans and curious tourists alike.

The cemetery originally opened in 1855, boasting gothic mausoleums, a regal and ornate entrance in a Romanesque brick style, and an eventual expansion of 400 acres of land to become the biggest burial site in Pennsylvania. Interestingly, no one actually owns the cemetery, which is part of why it became abandoned and forgotten. For a time, it seemed that Mount Moriah Cemetery would simply be reclaimed by nature, as the headstones and monuments within fell and overgrowth overtook even the wealthiest Victorian graves. That’s when the Friends Of Mount Moriah, a local non-profit group, stepped in to help. With years of work, more than half of the cemetery has been cleared up and is reopened for eager eyes and fun, if sobering, exploration.

An incredibly historic location, it is here in the park that the Declaration of Independence was signed, and the table that George Washington used is still on-site for visitors to ogle. It is also a World Heritage Site. The central feature of Independence National Historical Park is Independence Hall, a Georgian building of red brick available for ranger-led tours. The structure was Pennsylvania’s first legislative building and was built in 1763. Across the street, the Liberty Bell Center and its famous crack rest, two tons in weight, after its ringing in 1776 to celebrate Independence.

The gardens are a nonprofit group, a folk ark center, and a gallery for the works of Isaiah Zagar, a famous mosaicist, on the site of his biggest public installation of art. In the late 1960s, Zagar began focusing his efforts on beautifying the neighborhood of South Street after moving here with his wife. The couple helped revive the area by buying and refurbishing buildings that were falling apart, using vibrant mosaics to color the walls and bring life to them. The first building they did this with was the Eyes Gallery, which remains open and doing well now. Zagar’s work on the Magic Gardens began in 1994, using a vacant lot that was close to his studio. For 14 years, he excavated grottos and tunnels, sculptured walls in layers, added grouting and tiling and perfected 3,000 square feet of space. A mix of found objects, community contributions, and more cover half a block in Pennsylvania with bright hues, textures, and tiles of all sorts. The labyrinth of the gardens is packed with sculptures, handmade art, and other objects, and it’s no wonder that the Magic Gardens are not a permanent art institution hosting live entertainment and public workshops run by the man himself, Zagar!

It is an enhanced cave of sorts, fitted into a hillside, its one entrance marked by a stone frame. It is here that it is thought that the first mystic cult in America lived in the 17th century. Supposedly, the cave was settled by Johannes Kelpius, a scholar and mystic, with his 40 all-male followers in 1694. He believed that the world would come to an end that year due to his interpretation of the Book of Revelation. They were known as The Society of the Woman of the Wilderness, after a passage in Revelation where a woman ran to hide from the end of the world in the wilderness. They were also called, simply, the Hermits of the Wissahickon, which lends itself to the name of the area: Hermit’s Glen, marked in present-day Pennsylvania by the road Hermit Lane. In the Cave of Kelpius, the group practiced astronomy and used the space to meet and as an observatory. They remained there even after the world did not end, and they continued to study the skies, make music and art, and even help the community. In 1708, Kelpius died, and the group largely disbanded, with many remaining in the area to serve as lawyers and doctors. The cave is largely demolished now, with only the stone structure outside remaining, but it’s a fascinating visit steeped in history.

It is a hidden gem among tourist attractions, but one of the country’s best examples of genuine Japanese design from centuries ago. The name “Shofuso” roughly means “Pine Breeze Villa” and was made as part of a House in the Garden exhibit for the Museum of Modern Art. The Shofuso Japanese House and Garden was made by Junzō Yoshimura, an architect, who built it in Japan in 1953. It was sent and assembled in the following year, given to America as a gift from Japan. For a while, the Museum of Modern Art held onto it, and then the exhibition closed and it was moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1958. The house of the Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is designed following shoin-zukuri architecture and proportions. It is meant to resemble a temple guest house, boasting a kitchen, tea room, and bath and topped with a roof of hinoki bark that had to be specially requested from the National Forestry Agency of Japan. The gardens, on the other hand, are host to a tea garden, courtyard garden, koi pond, and a little island. Vandalism and abandonment left the Shofuso Japanese House and Garden in disrepair for years. Famous Japanese painter Hiroshi Senju helped refurbish it in 2007, donating 20 murals to the grounds. Now, the place is very much perked up, and it’s one of the greatest tourist attractions in the state.

Fonthill Castle was the home of Henry Chapman Mercer, a famous collector, tile maker, and archaeologist. He planned the house completely, from the exterior to each interior room, which he sketched and imagined himself. Fonthill Castle was finished in 1912 and is made completely from poured concrete, somehow ornate and somehow impossible to categorize from an architectural standpoint. The use of pure concrete was due to Mercer’s fear of fires, which developed after he lost some medieval armor that he was storing while building the museum to the Great Boston Fire. People made fun of him – but he demonstrated the effectiveness of such construction by building a huge bonfire on an upper terrace and allowing it to rage, high enough for all residents of the surrounding Doylestown to see. Mercer was a little “mad”, though – or at least extremely eccentric, especially for the surrounding Pennsylvania town. Despite his personal loathing for “false taste” and “ugliness”, Fonthill Castle is extremely strangely built and reflects a style and reason that only he truly understands. 32 stairs, 8 bedrooms, roof pitch, vaulted ceilings, and unpainted walls… it makes for quite the sight! Meanwhile, Mercer Museum nearby houses all sorts of “average American” tools used from the 18th to 19th centuries. Watchmakers’ gears, tortoiseshell comb makers’ supplies, whalers’ boats, butchers’ instruments, a fake vampire hunting kit, and more. The museum is also made from pure concrete and houses 55 exhibit rooms that each concentrate on different trades from pre-industrial times, such as farming, metalsmithing, milling, woodworking, and sewing tools. There are also strange objects like unorthodox fire engines, a whaleboat, gallows, and stove plates. The museum was opened in 1916 and has since included the addition of a children’s room on the highest floor.

The rocks had been taken from Upper Black Eddy in Pennsylvania, or what is known now as . The field of rock spans 7 acres and is more than 10 feet deep with these rocks. Tests by scientists in 1965 revealed that all the rocks here ring at different tones, even if those tones are ones that human ears can’t hear.

The first pendulum of this kind was made by Léon Foucault in 1851, who constructed a 67-foot heavy pendulum and hung it from a ceiling over a circular protractor. The device would appear to swing in a circle throughout the day, but it was not, itself, moving – it was the earth’s rotation beneath it that moved. This was Foucault’s elegant method of providing that the Earth rotates on its axis. Now, the Foucault Pendulum of the Franklin Institute is a great way to view the experiment for yourself. It took 11 people to install and hangs from a wire of 85 feet! The orb swings approximately every 20 minutes, taking 10 seconds to swing back and forth, knocking over pegs around a circle as it goes.

The archaeological site of Delphi stands on the slopes of Mount Parnassus overlooking a valley filled with olive groves. Delphi is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of the importance of its 4th-century BC pan-Hellenic sanctuaries. With vistas of mountains in the background, the ruins of the Temple of Athena look especially splendid in photos. Delphi is a , but if you want to visit the site and enjoy the area, plan on spending a night. Another popular tourist destination on Crete is Agios Nikolaos. This small city has several popular sites for photographers. The beautiful port area looks out over Mirabello Bay to mountains on the far shore. Just inland from the port is the small but deep Lake Voulismeni , lined with restaurants and shops and backed by a cliff wall. In the vicinity are some of , including the stunning Voulisma Beach . You can also find a number of nearby. Surrounded by vine-covered rolling hills, olive groves, and pine forests, Kokkari on Sámos Island is an idyllic seaside town with an attractive port. Kokkari was originally a small fishing village, evidenced by the traditional Greek boats moored in the harbor. Nowadays Kokkari is a crowded resort destination during summertime. Folégandros Island's main town, Chora, offers wonderful spots to photograph at every turn: tree-shaded squares, narrow pedestrian alleyways, buildings trimmed in bougainvillea, and quaint whitewashed houses with blue-framed windows and doors. At the highest point of this medieval clifftop town is the Church of Panagia overlooking the Aegean. The steep uphill trek (a 15-minute walk) to the church rewards photographers with the breathtaking seaside panoramas. The seaside village of Assos resembles a watercolor painting. Its picturesque fishing port is tucked into a tranquil bay surrounded by verdant pine forests and lush vegetation. Pretty houses in eye-catching hues nestle on hillsides above the harbor, which is lined with seafood tavernas. Nearby, along the coastline, is the cliff-fringed Myrtos Beach , one of the most often photographed beaches in Greece. Apella Beach on Kárpathos Island seduces visitors with its golden-sand shore and crystal-clear, turquoise waters. Steep cliffs and rocky, pine-clad hillsides surround the beach, giving it a secluded feel. Parga boasts a photogenic waterfront backed by hillsides dotted with colorful houses. Other picture-perfect sights include the hilltop ruins of a Venetian castle and the white church in front of the town's port. On the slopes of a mountain that drops off into the Aegean Sea, the dramatically situated village of Olympos was until recently nearly inaccessible. As a result, the village has retained an old-fashioned way of life. Women wear traditional costumes on religious feast days. Agnontas is a quiet fishing village nestled in a postcard-perfect bay. The surrounding hillsides are covered with dense pine forests, while the serene emerald waters are truly dazzling. Agnontas Bay looks especially romantic at sunset. "

But what does the threat of a “Grexit”– the hyperbolic term for dropping out of the eurozone and reverting to its old currency, the drachma– mean for travelers hoping to visit this ancient land? According to Andreas Andreadis, president of the Greek Tourism Confederation known as , there is no cause for travelers to be concerned. “Greece is beautiful, peaceful and quiet. I don’t believe there’s a risk of a strike or protest,” he said in a CNN interview. “In the worst case scenario banks will have capital controls, but that will not affect tourists. Money will be available and credit cards will work. Greece is the best value for money this year.” The truth is that Greece’s financial issues ensure that strong currencies such as the U.S. dollar and Euro will stretch further than ever before. And because we loved the country so much during our 16-day island-hopping tour, we wanted to share 40 of the best places to visit in Greece. We hope their beauty will encourage you to book your ticket to the cradle of Western civilization asap… Located in the Saronic Gulf about 27 km from Athens, Aegina is accessible via a 40-minute boat road from Piraeus port. The island was an impressive sea power that rivaled Athens during ancient times (657-459 BC). From 1827 to 1829, it was proclaimed the first capital of Greece. These days it’s best known as a weekend getaway for Athenians, with its bustling harbor lined with fishing boats and luxury yachts. What you won’t find here is many tourists, even at impressive attractions such as the ancient Temple of Aphaia and the church of Aghios Naktarios. A prime launching point for exploration of the or the Peloponnese peninsula, Aegina is also a great place to immerse yourself in everyday Greek life. Savor the view from one of the many waterfront tavernas, wander alleys lined with shops, and make sure to pick up some local Pistachios, considered the finest in Greece due to the ideal climate and soil composition. READ MORE: The Temple of Aphaia, built in 500BC to honor a local goddess associated with fertility and agriculture. It also offers exceptional views of Athens’ coast line. The church of Agios Nektarios– built to honor a Greek Orthodox saint who died in 1920– was still being constructed when we visited. The faithful flock here to ask the miracle worker for help. Fishermen, churchgoers, vendors selling fresh fruit and seafood, and vacationing Greeks alike take to Aegina’s streets on a sunny Sunday morning. A Pistachio vendor readies her display for the day in one of Aegina’s charming alleys. The nuts are available in a variety of flavors, candies, pastries and spreads. Trying to adequately summarize one of the world’s greatest cities in a few hundred words is an exercise in futility. is practically littered with monuments and masterpieces from antiquity and the Middle Ages, and is widely considered the cradle of civilization. Inhabited since the Neolithic age, Athens reached the height of its influence in the 5th century BC. Modern Democracy, politics, philosophy, the arts, music, theatre, architecture, mathematics, science, gastronomy and logic all took root here over 6000 years ago. And though Greece may have fallen on hard economic times in recent years, there’s a new generation of artists, activists and creative talent ready to usher in a new era of prosperity. We saw a very different side of the city than most tourists get to see via a tour with , which was founded by Yiannis Skevis and his wife Colleen McGuire. After meeting the couple at TBEX Athens, we took a bicycle tour that started at the Acropolis and made its way down to the heart of the ancient city. The bike tour ultimately proved the best way to explore what is inarguably among the best places to visit in Greece. READ MORE: Visiting the Parthenon was an incredibly emotional experience for me, as it allowed me to recreate a photo of my late Grandfather (one of my earliest travel inspirations) that was taken in the mid- ’70s. is considered the birthplace of Democracy. Up to 10,000 Athenians would gather here to hear orators speak and participate in the political process. The Athens neighborhood of Psirri is filled with amazing street art. This mural pays tribute to Loukanikos, a stray “ ” who became a world-renowned symbol of Greek protests against austerity measures after he sided with those under attack by police. He died a few weeks before our visit. We heard music everywhere we went in Greece, but Athens was especially packed with street musicians busking for change. This man plays a modern version of the , which dates back to at least the 9th century. is the largest and most populated Greek Island, with around 625,000 residents. Archaeological evidence suggests that humans (or pre-human hominids) may have reached the island 130,000 years ago, but we know for certain that modern humans have lived there for 10,000-12,000 years. Crete was the heart of the Minoan civilization, which lasted from 2700 to 1420 BC and is considered the earliest recorded civilization in all of Europe. The Minoans are known for their monumental palaces, the most famous of which can be found at the Bronze Age archaeological site of , the ceremonial and political center of Minoan culture. Originally uncovered by Minos Kalokairinos in 1878, the palace was excavated by Sir Arthur Evans in the early 20th century, and is still being investigated by the British School of Archaeology today. READ MORE: Knossos is arranged like a maze of living spaces, workrooms and storerooms around a central square. But its most impressive features are the murals and frescos. This one shows dolphins and various colorful fish, reflecting their relationship with the sea. The walls of the Knossos throne room are decorated with a fresco depicting griffins, which have the head of an eagle (King of the Birds) and the body of a lion (King of the Beasts). T he mythological griffin was believed to be an especially powerful creature. According to Greek mythology, King Minos ordered the architect Daedalus to construct a labyrinth in which to keep his son, the Minotaur. There’s lots of bull imagery in Knossos today, but none more striking than this fresco of a charging bull, backlit by a brilliant rainbow. One of the least known (and least populated) Greek islands, calm, quiet is tucked away in the Saronic Gulf in a narrow passage en route from Hydra to Spetses. Primarily frequented by yachts taking advantage the clear waters and shelter provided by picturesque Skintos Bay, the island’s main features are a small chapel devoted to Saint Nicolas, a rocky mound reaching 308 meters, and a few sheep herders who live there year-round. It also boasts archaeological remains including ruins of a great Byzantine castle, 100 houses, and pre-historic tombs and walls from the early Hellenistic times. But Dokos’ most famous feature actually lies hidden offshore. In 1975, Peter Throckmorton found the remains of the oldest shipwreck in the world here, dating back to 2700-2200 BC. The ship was gone, but hundreds of clay vases and other ceramic items were found, along with stone anchors and tableware. The artifacts were excavated in 1989-1992, and are displayed at a museum on Spetses.

Enjoying some fresh-grilled Mediterranean cuisine with a spectacular view of Dokos Island. Working off the meal with a bit of kayaking around Skintos Bay. has a reputation for being a non-stop glamorous party, with beachside bars blaring bass-thumping techno music until the wee hours of the morning. But when we visited, just after sunset in the early Autumn shoulder season, it was surprisingly quiet. It was also chilly, earning its nickname “The island of the winds.” In Greek mythology, the island was named after its first ruler, Mykons, a descendant of the god Apollo. Mykonos was also said to have been the location where Hercules killed the Titans after having lured them from the protection of Mount Olympus. The large rocks found all over the island were said to be the Titans’ petrified testicles, which is the original source of the slang term “stones.” We only spent one night in Mykonos, mostly exploring Little Venice, where rows of fishing houses line the picturesque waterfront. Originally owned by rich merchants and sea captains, these 18th century building have now been converted in restaurants, bars, shops and galleries. It was a remarkably romantic setting for a sunset stroll. READ MORE: Our friend Angie Orth of proved a perfect Mykonos guide, having spent a lot of time there. She insisted we had to have dinner at Katerina’s in Little Venice, which ultimately proved to be one of our most exquisite meals in Greece. It was a magnificent Mediterranean meal, with Grilled Calamari the size of a T-bone steak, spaghetti topped with massive Langostino, scrumptious homemade Pistachio Baklava for dessert, and lots and lots of crisp white wine. It’s easy to get turned around in the winding alleyways of Little Venice, but even getting a little lost proved memorable. This t-shirt says it all! , which is actually two islands (Kalavria and Sferia) connected by a bridge, is one of the smallest Saronic Islands at a mere 49 square kilometers. Located just 31 nautical miles from Athens, Poros is separated from the Peloponnese by a slim 200-meter wide channel. The islands offer small-town charm and a lovely waterfront lined with 2-story neoclassical buildings with terra-cotta roofs and wooden balconies. With its forested hills and pine trees lining the shores, Poros feels a bit like a lakeside resort in the Alps. But the lively seafront is filled with tavernas and souvenir shops, and a walk up to the iconic clock tower provides impressive scenic views. READ MORE: Poros is renowned for its beautiful beaches, including Nerion Beach, Love Bay Beach, Kanali Beach and Askeli Beach. But the water was too chilly for us, so we enjoyed sitting on the top deck of the Galileo and taking in the dazzling sunset view. We had the sort of meal on Poros that you tell stories about for years. Massive platters of grilled fish, shrimp, octopus and shellfish were perfectly prepared, and we were surrounded by adorable kittens begging to be fed. Unfortunately, we left our camera on the boat. So instead we give you this shot of a fresh octopus for sale. Located just off the Anatolian coast of Turkey, Rhodes is one of the most popular and unique of all the Greek Islands. Its nickname, “the island of the Knights,” is a tribute to the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem, the most famous Roman Catholic military order of the Middle Ages, who conquered the island after a difficult 3-year campaign in 1309. Overseen by Grand Master Antonio Fluvian de Riviere, the Knights Hospitaller (as they were known) began a 200-year process of rebuilding the existing Byzantine fortifications around the town, expanding the walls to encompass 104 acres of land. Stretching about four kilometers, the walls are 12 meters thick, with 11 gates and a 21-meter wide moat to control access, numerous bastions and towers, and the impressive Palace of the Grand Master. The fortress withstood numerous siege attempts by the Egyptians and Ottomans during the 15th century. But in 1522 the Turks finally conquered, and the surviving Knights were expelled (many relocated to Malta, where they built a similar fortification). Today, the is a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site, and ranks alongside and Ephesus among the greatest ancient cities we’ve ever explored. READ MORE: Guided tours of the Medieval City are popular, but we decided to explore at a more leisurely pace with our friends. We spotted this fisherman tenderizing his octopus catch as we made our way towards the Palace of the Grandmaster. The Gate d’Amboise, located just below the Palace of the Grand Master, boasts a triple defensive belt with chemins de ronde, two round towers and a covered entrance. The Saint George bastion used cannons to control access through the gate. Feral cats are everywhere in Greece, but they seem to have a particular fondness for the ruins. They were surprisingly friendly… you know, for cats. Colorful shoes on display at a souvenir shop. A lone sailboat floats off the coast of Rhodes at sunset. , with its stunning coastline and striking blue-and-white domed churches, is at the top of nearly every Greek island-hopper’s bucket list. And deservedly so: It has the ancient archaeological site being excavated at Akrotiri and the active volcano that created the island’s stunning 150-300 meter cliffs. It has charming houses, beautiful beaches, and arguably the world’s most romantic sunsets. In short, Santorini epitomizes the Greek Islands that most travelers fantasize all their lives about visiting. Oia (pronounced “Ia”) is the most famous of Santorini’s villages, but we were equally charmed by the capital city Fira, with its quiet Catholic Cathedral and cliffside cafes affording brilliant views. If you get the chance, try to make your way to Mt. Profitis Ilias, whose 567-meter height promises a breathtaking panorama of the island. READ MORE: We opted to take the sky tram, but Donkeys are traditionally used to transport travelers (and their gear) up Santorini’s steep cliffs. Poor Donkeys… In contrast to the blue-domed white churches in Oia, this church in Fira was yellow and blue, with a white dome. And that blue sky? That’s totally unfiltered. We loved these green bells atop a church in Oia, with a view of the deep turquoise waters of Santorini’s volcanic caldera in the background. No caption needed here: The picture is worth a thousand words! Another of the smaller, sleepier Sardonic Islands, measures around 27 square kilometers, with a total population of just over 4,000 people. Its name is a derivation of Isola delle Spezzie– the Island of Fragrance– a nickname it earned due to the many herbs you’ll find growing in the island’s mountains. Situated opposite the Peloponnesian coast of Ermionida, the island’s charming waterfront is a mixture of quaint and cosmopolitan. We loved its neoclassical architecture and elevated square (known as the Dapia ), which was offset by quiet beaches and picturesque bays. There are no private automobiles allowed within the town limits, so walking, horse-drawn carriages, bicycles and mopeds are the most common forms of transport. We spent hours strolling the romantic waterfront and back alleys. READ MORE: After drinking Ouzo with British travelers we met at a cozy seaside bar, we headed to Liotrivi Restaurant on a recommendation from our Galileo activities director. The locals we encountered spoke no English, but still managed to help us find our way. The gyros and wine were almost as spectacular as our view of the old port’s bay. There are many things we’ll never forget about Greece: The warmth of its people, the richness of its culture, the dynamic stories of its history and mythology. But this shot captures one of my favorite aspects of the islands– the radiant colors, which require no filters. Greece doesn’t need any tricks or gimmicks to overwhelm you with its beauty. Even unfiltered, the country casts a magical spell that never lets go. –by Bret Love; photos by Bret Love & Mary Gabbett Our trip to the Greek Islands was hosted in part by and .

Thus, rather than just rattling off every single photo location in the country, I thought I’d pick and choose my absolute favorites. It should be noted too that I’ve done a couple Greece photography trips now, so some of the images below are from previous visits. It should also be noted that as time moves forward, and I return here or visit new islands I’ll update this with some of the new beautiful places in Greece I find. So without further ado, I’m going to get into these locations. Here they are! On there are a lot of beautiful places. Some of them are great to look but aren’t very photogenic. But just outside of , though, there’s a photography spot that’s to die for. It’s a church out to sea sat on a seawall. I had a bit of a mission to get there as the waves were smashing up against the wave break. But, once I got out among the rocks it was epic. Easily my favourite photo from Greece. And easily my favourite Greece photography spot. Everyone who spends time here knows that Santorini is one of the most beautiful places in Greece. It’s famous for its blue and white buildings and sunsets that leave you breathless. But, with so many people posting images of Santorini there are plenty of people who worry that it’s overrated. And to be honest, when I was there I struggled with a couple things: access and crowds. I also found it hard to find unique images that there aren’t hundreds of already online. Oia is the classic photo spot. And while most people head to Oia Castle, I hiked down a path a little bit lower to get a different angle that incorporated the port. Over in Thira, the beautiful 3 bells church is a fantastic photo spot as well. And, finally, a hike down the hill to Agios Nikolaos Church is a fantastic place for sunset. I’m really not sure why more people don’t go to Syros. It is seriously beautiful. In fact, I had as much fun shooting photography in Syros as any other island in Greece. That said, I definitely had a favourite location. If you follow the GPS coordinates ( 37°26’42.0″N 24°56’43.4″E ) you’ll get to a little alleyway down to the water. Down there, you have some rocks that work as a beautiful foreground to the church on the hill. It is seriously beautiful. And, don’t think you need great camera gear to get a cool photo here, it’s one of those places that is just naturally photogenic. We were based in Heraklion, and I worried before going that there wasn’t going to be enough photo opportunities there. I mean, Heraklion isn’t exactly known as one of the best Greece photography places. But, as soon as I saw the old port I knew I was going to have some fun there. In fact, there are at least 3 photo locations down on the port. The first is of the old port itself with the boats in the foreground. The second is of the massive wave-break leading out to the sea. And the third is from the wavebreak back towards the city or just of the castle; which admittedly I haven’t photographed yet. We got to Chania after dark and it was absolutely packed with tourists. In fact, we were a bit stressed out. There were so many people that it seemed like it was going to be a nightmare for photography. But, we decided to sleep on it and head out first thing at dawn to explore some of the streets and get a couple images. I’m glad we did. Check out the vlog below from the morning. In the end, Chania is Greece photography perfection. Yes, it was busy in the evening. But at dawn there were some beautiful images to be made down on the old port. There was also just a countless number of street photography opportunities. I was left sure that Chania is one of the most beautiful places in Greece. And, the crazy part is that we didn’t even go what might be the best photography location in Chania which is the abandoned factory. I will get back and shoot that spot at some point! So many people head directly to the Greek Islands totally neglecting the mainland. And while I’m a bit guilty of that too – having spent the vast majority of my time in Greece on the islands – there are a bunch of cool photo spots on the mainland. In fact, I’d argue that one of the top 3 most beautiful places in Greece is on the mainland. Meteora is phenomenal. This place is just incredible, and you don’t need to be a photographer to appreciate it. With monasteries up on cliff tops, there are few places in the world like it. No Greece photography trip is complete without a visit here. As for specific locations, I can honestly say that there are dozens of places to shoot from here. Plan on spending a couple days here and explore. I’m always a little bit surprised by the disdain that people seem to have for Athens. I liked it! And, I think that it’s pretty photogenic. Sure, it’s not Santorini, but there are plenty of images to be made here. I had 3 favourite locations in Athens. The first location is Mount Lycabettus. From up here you get amazing views of all of Athens. With a long lens you can pick off some of the iconic buildings. The second photography location is Filopappou Hill. This is such a great place to photograph the Acropolis. It’s also just a great place to hang out and watch the sunset. Finally, the Academy of Athens is a beautiful building. If you come, though, its best to photograph this at dawn in the blue hour as it’ll be the quietest. There’s a pretty classic taken from out near Apollo Temple looking back into the city. If you get lucky with the light, it could be the most beautiful photo location in the country. But, what surprised me about Naxos was that there were so many other photo opportunities out on the island. In fact, I’m surprised it’s not a part of more photographer’s Greece photography trips. It really has a little bit of everything: street photography, landscapes, and cityscapes. Especially for travel photographers, this island is fantastic. These are my 3 favourite locations in Naxos. The first is from out at the door to Apollo’s temple looking back at the city. The second image is up at this incredible Church Agios Ioannis above the town of Filoti. The drive up is interesting, but it’s so worth it. The GPS coordinates . Thirdly, I’m a big fan of the location down on the coast to the north of town. If you get lucky with the light like I did, you’ll get some epic Greece pics. Of course, don’t forget the street photography options down in the old market area. Apart from Santorini, no island in Greece gets more attention than Mykonos. And its with good reason. Mykonos might have been our favourite island. It was a blend of farm and villa. Almost like a symbiotic relationship between tourist and lifelong local. It was fantastic. But, I think Mykonos is a tough place to photograph. Yes, you have the classic shot of the windmills which . But aside from that there really aren’t all that many spots to shoot that are “easy”. That said, I think that it would be a fun place to photograph for the sheer reason that it’s a challenge. And, I think with the winds of Mykonos, there are plenty of cool seascapes worth shooting. We didn’t take pictures in Mykonos as it was Jodie’s birthday. But, I’m sure there are lots of great bits of inspiration on if you need them. Do you know of some more beautiful places in Greece for photography? If you do, I’d love to hear about them – as would the community. So, feel free to leave them below in the comments. I have had thoughts about doing a trip to Greece for a full photography workshop. However, if I’m being honest I’m not sure it’s going to happen. As beautiful as Greece is, organizing a photo trip here seems like a little bit of a mission. However, I won’t rule it out, especially if people start to call for one. If you want a workshop to Greece, drop a comment below. If that’s something that might interest you please head over to and sign up for the newsletter, in case it happens. I also explored these fabulous places in my these tours and have a joyful time with mates. I’m interesting to join photography workshop on late May 2020 Your email address will not be published.

        "description": "Jan The majority of shops selling postcards in Greece will have photographs from Santorini and once you visit realize why this is Greek",
        "html_text": "With over a thousand islands and a territory that stretches from the south Aegean Sea to the middle of the Balkan peninsula, Greece is one of the most popular travel destinations in the world. The sun-drenched European country is equally as known for its serene sandy beaches as its astoundingly rich ancient history which has had a huge influence on so many aspects of today’s western society. With such a diverse range of Greek destinations on offer, all tastes are catered for – from history fans to serious clubbers. It’s virtually an impossible task to choose the best and most beautiful places to visit in Greece but here are twenty places that have left a life-long impression on me… Santorini is one of the Cyclades islands nestled in the Aegean Sea. This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful and romantic islands in the world. Spectacular sunsets, traditional whitewashed houses and the breathtaking sights of the ocean is what makes this island so special. Head to Oia for the iconic village of pastel-washed houses hugging the cliff face. The majority of shops selling postcards in Greece will have photographs from Santorini and once you visit you’ll realize why this is Greek place is so cherished. This island stands out as one of the most beautiful in the Aegean region and makes a fantastic destination to explore in Greece. Belonging to the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea, although Mykonos is a popular party island there is still plenty of natural and traditional beauty on offer. Mykonos has a collection of unique Cycladic architecture set around a picturesque fishing village bay. The square whitewashed buildings sit closely together forming a maze of narrow alleyways and streets and are highly photogenic. The island’s beautiful beaches also make a perfect backdrop to watch the sunset. A gift of the Ionian Sea, Zakynthos might bear a Venetian name but was mentioned by Homer in both the Odyssey and Illiad. This beautiful Greek gem of a place is famous globally for its crystal clear blue waters, golden beaches, and intense adventures, especially at night. Zakynthos offers lots of scenic outings, especially the Shipwreck Beach of Navagio in a secluded cove, including Banana, Porto Zoro, Kalamaki, and Gerakas. Zakynthos Town is home to dozens of museums and an interesting Venetian Castle on the hilltop. Picturesque mountainous villages are scattered across the countryside, including old monasteries easily discovered by car.

One of the most attractive travel destinations in Greece! The popular Greek holiday island has been made famous by the novel Captain Corelli’s Mandolin which was set here. This is one of the most picturesque spots to discover in Greece. Although there some development it still retains a traditional Greek way of life.

The sheer contrast of the bright blue waters and the sparkling white beach makes an exhilarating scene especially when viewed from the very steep mountains and cliffs. Rhodes – the largest of Greece’s Dodecanese islands – is another popular holiday island in Greece and although it’s home to some lively resorts there are still many areas of outstanding natural beauty to discover and explore. Here you can find Lindos and St. Pauls’s Beaches. Lindos is more popular because of its turquoise waters and the view of the raised white-painted town from the beach. Both beaches are sandy, white and exceptionally beautiful. Agathi Beach is another pretty beach on the island known for its soft sand and emerald green waters. Looking for history? There are many ancient ruins here and also remnants of its occupation by the Knights of St. John during the Crusades. If you’re visiting Greece, there are many breathtaking historical sites to explore but this world-famous Greek destination is considered to be the most important surviving building of Classical Greece. Found in the centre of the Greece capital Athens, it’s ruins of an ancient temple on the Athenian Acropolis dedicated to the maiden goddess Athena and built for a couple of decades starting 447BC. Also make time to explore the rest of , the capital and one of the best Greece cities. Corfu is a must when it comes to visiting Greece. This beautiful place is one of the most romantic islands in the Ionian archipelago where you can explore their historic heritage that is inspired by Venetian and Byzantine styles.

This is an island on the southern side of Greece which is home to the myth-surrounded Mt. Zeus. Relatively undiscovered by the tourist masses Naxos is one of the highlights of travelling to Greece. It’s one of the greenest island in the Cyclades with high mountains and fertile valleys. The beaches here are among the most beautiful in Greece – long and sandy and perfect for swimming, water sports and relaxing. The traditional white-painted villages and winemaking factories are also another draws as well as port towns filled with whitewashed, cube-shaped houses and medieval Venetian mansions. One of the must-see attractions in Greece is an island in the Ionian Sea, Lefkada can be found towards Greece’s west coast and is connected to Greece’s mainland through a floating bridge and causeway.

The complex of six monasteries are built precariously perched atop 1,300 feet high sandstone pinnacles, at the northwestern edge of the Plain of Thessaly near the beautiful Pineios river and Pindus Mountains. The occupants of the buildings located atop vertically steep rocks definitely had a rough time climbing down, but so was their climb up. It is an awesome apparition that has the ability to leave you speechless – easily one of the best places to discover in Greece! In the Eastern Peloponnese region of Argolis is Nafplio, a romantic Greek seaport town and an earlier capital of the new state of Greece between 1821 and 1834.

Delphi is both an archaeological site and a modern town in Greece on the south-western spur of Mount Parnassus in the valley of Phocis. The Delphi theatre was constructed atop a hill facing the beautiful valley in the 4 th century and is now classed as a UNESCO world heritage site. Built as the sanctuary and oracle of Apollo, its 35 rows could hold up to 5,000 guests who in ancient times enjoyed plays, poetry readings, and musical events. The stunning historic site in Greece and the sheer beauty of the landscape below easily makes it worth the effort to get to. Declared a National Park in 1938, Mountain Olympus is Greek’s highest mountain rising 9,573 feet on its highest peak. The area is popular for stunning and charming features from thick forests, alpine fields, prominent rock peaks and intensely deep gorges. In Greek mythology, Mount Olympus is famous as the residence of the 12 gods of ancient Greece. Olympus is rich in fauna and flora with rare and typical 1700 plant species spread around the region. Due to the popularity of this beautiful area in Greece, numerous campsites and inexpensive hotels have sprung up. Litochoro is the main village easily accessed from Athens by train and bus.

        "description": "Sep Top Instagrammable Places In Greece Sarakiniko Milos Melissani Kefalonia Meteora Monasteries Mykonos Town",
        "html_text": "Unique Experiences and Travel Inspiration We’re certain that there have been many instances in which you’ve seen gorgeous picture-perfect shots from Greece on Instagram and have wanted to be transported there immediately. We’ve curated this list of must-visit spots in the Greek islands to help you capture some gloriously aesthetic pictures not just for social media, but also to ingrain the most beautiful memories in your mind. Greece is brimming with natural beauty wherever you look with its rich history, pristine beaches, and gorgeous turquoise waters. Visiting Greece is always a good idea and it makes for the best vacation for any type of traveler. Choosing which places to visit in this country is a hard task, so let’s dive into a list of the most Instagrammable places in Greece! No trip to the Greek islands’ beaches would be complete without stopping by this magnificent beach, which is located on the north shore of the island of Milos. One of the beaches in Greece that receives the most photography is Sarakiniko. It is also one of the most Instagrammable places in Greece and offers the perfect setting for taking photos that are aesthetic, ethereal, and otherworldly. It is absolutely understandable why the locals call the picturesque shore of this beach “Lunar,” since it bears a striking similarity to the moon’s surface due to the waves of white-gray volcanic rock that it is formed of. The stark contrast of the moon-like off-white shore with the deep turquoise waters with several blue-green shades makes for an experience like never before! The Melissani Cave is a magnificent naturally-occurring phenomenon nearby surrounded by a number of Ionian islands. You would definitely feel like you’re on a different planet while visiting this sea cave. You might have to wait in a queue to take a boat ride through the caverns in the cave, but it will certainly be worth it. Several people visit Greece just to witness this beautiful phenomenon. Take a boat ride through the caverns and take in the breathtaking blue-green water as the sunshine filters through the cave’s openings and chambers to shine on the water, making it glisten. Do not pass on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Photography lovers would surely enjoy taking some amazing photos here! The Meteora Monasteries in Thessaly on the Greek mainland are perched on enormous rock formations that naturally formed as part of a unique geological occurrence millions of years ago. One of the must-do things, when you visit Greece, is to go to Meteora, a well-known UNESCO world heritage site. Famous for its rich history, incredible views, and mind-blowing placement on the high rock formations, the gram-worthy pictures you take here are sure to impress people! Six of the 24 monasteries that were constructed atop these “columns of the sky” by monks who first settled here in the 11th century are still in use today. The monasteries are just ten minutes by car from Kalabaka and are located in central Greece. While the ascent of the rocky outcrops may be challenging, it is unquestionably worthwhile. We advise scheduling a tour of the monasteries to make things simpler. Mykonos town has a lot to offer and explore right from the most bustling nightlife experiences to gorgeous beaches and delicious local cuisine. Although, one of the top Instagrammable places in Greece would be the windmills in Mykonos town. There are several windmill spots across Mykonos, but none of them are functional today. They were built by Venetian settlers in the 16th century and are still intact. They look beautiful and scenic against the sky and make for the best photo opportunity. Pictures of the breathtaking blue domes on the churches in Santorini overlooking the sea are famous all over the world. One of the highly popular attractions and most Instagrammable places in Greece, Santorini is the most romantic island you will ever visit. This city offers stunning sunsets and magnificent views of the Aegean Sea from every section of the crazy and winding roads. Its picture-perfect postcard look lined with the whitewashed stone walls of traditional Cycladic houses, bearing a stark contrast to the blue domes on the churches is a sight that each individual must experience. There are many famous photo spots in Santorini that you can cover including their whitewashed villages and black sand beaches. Since all the landscapes are shaped by sloping volcanic rock on the ocean, you will be able to enjoy the most fantastic views in all of Greece. The Anastasis church is the place to get the perfect shot of white buildings with blue domes! Corfu is an island that you must visit on your trip to Greece. An Ionian island, the old town, and the beaches on this island are absolutely breathtaking. Expect Venetian architecture, colorful flowers, and narrow streets with quaint cafes in Corfu town, while you can expect lovely peaceful beaches that make for the most Instagrammable spots. Visit the sandy Sidari beach in Corfu to have a very relaxed time. Be sure to then visit Canal d’Amour which is a natural rock formation that creates a tunnel-like inlet into the sea and legend has it that if you swim here alongside your partner, you will be together forever! The Athens’ Acropolis, known as the old town of Athens, is the largest ancient Greek architectural complex still standing today. This iconic UNESCO world heritage site is perched atop a hill and is a feast for the eyes of everyone who enjoys history and the ancient Greek ruins. It is a must-see landmark located right in Athens’ city center. The most important structure on the Acropolis, the Parthenon stands erect on the hill’s summit and represents the timeless beauty of ancient Athens. You would also find remnants of an ancient sculpture here. Visit the Acropolis Museum, which is an archaeological museum that preserves the artifacts from this archaeological site, to discover more about Greece’s ancient past. Then, proceed to the Ancient Agora, which was a well-known meeting spot in the ancient city, located on the northwest side of the Acropolis. There are several ancient temples in this area as well, such as the Temple of Olympian Zeus. Exploring this structure’s architecture personally is must have experience in Greece and you’ll find that this is one of the top historic Instagrammable places in Greece. One of the most well-known beaches in Greece is the Navagio beach, often referred to as Shipwreck Beach. On the Zakynthos coast, one of the islands in the Ionian Sea, the wreckage of a ship alleged to have carried illegal cigarettes in the early 1980s is perched on an exposed bay in a remote cove. One of the most popular white sand beaches in Greece with its gorgeous deep blue turquoise waters and the majestic freestanding ship wreckage that draw people to observe this unusual feat, this hidden gem is truly a sight to behold. On the island of Zakynthos, there are also several incredible sea caves that are unlike anything you’ve ever seen. This beach can get pretty crowded during the peak tourism seasons, but it is a must-visit all the same! The Elafonisi beach, which is located on the island of Crete, is one of Greece’s most distinctive and stunning beaches. This beach is well-known for its distinctive pink ombré coastline, which is made up of pink broken seashells and white sand, creating a lovely pastel contrast with the clear, blue-green ocean. Elafonisi beach, which was formerly a well-kept secret, is now a well-liked vacation spot during the high season but is a must-see no matter what time of year you visit the Greek islands.

Greece is world-famous for countless reasons: the food (ahem: CHEESE!), islands, beaches, architecture, and ruins. The history of Greece is just one example of the resilience of both the people and the country itself, and despite recent negative media attention, I believe Greece will continue to thrive as it has done for thousands of years. After one month of traveling there, these are my 20 favorite pictures of Greece. The Acropolis is, perhaps, one of Athens’ most iconic structures. Well known for its history and architecture, Greece is full of ruins, many of which are still standing today. They serve as an important reminder of where this country came from. I recommend you take a . Few pools in the world could match this one. Located along the road to Akrotiri, this hotel will cost you a pretty penny, but the view has got to be worth every single one. There’s nothing quite as quaint as dining in Greece. This table for two was found in the old city of Plaka on the island of Milos. In typical fashion, bright whites, blues, and greens pervaded in every direction. Pro Tip: Visiting Milos? Don’t miss , one of my favorite restaurants on the whole island. A classic view of the port town of Ermoupoli on . The Acropolis is perched high atop a hill in Athens and provides, without doubt, one of the best views of the city (and maybe one of the best pictures of Greece!). Don’t get too close to the edge, though—the security guards are all over it! Pro Tip: Take a free, private tour of Athens (and the Acropolis) with . The sunset on Santorini may be the most iconic of all pictures of Greece. Though crowded with tourists, the sunset was stunning, and is perfectly paired with a glass of red Greek wine. Pro Tip: Get to the village of Oia early in the evening if you want a good seat for the sunset. I only had two days in Mykonos, one of which was plagued by a colossal storm! No worries, though—the photos were magnificent! Taken on Paradise Beach. Pro Tip: If you like clubbing and international DJs, be sure to check out . One of the best things to do on the Greek island of Ios is rent a four-wheeler and go exploring! Of course, the rental companies tell you not to go off road, but (also, it was totally worth it). Pro Tip: Visiting Ios? Stay at . If there’s one thing the Greeks are famous for, it’s the cheese (and olives, to be fair). You’ll find cheese in just about every form, on just about any other type of food. This feta cheese was wrapped in filo, then friend, and topped with honey, sesame seeds, and raisins. Greece was host to some of the best sunsets I’ve ever seen. After climbing up the mountains in Meteora in the late hours of the evening, I perched myself atop a huge boulder and watched the sun come down over the ancient monasteries that this town is so well-known for. Fun Fact: These monasteries were built on top of tall rocks for security reasons—there is no way to access them other than by climbing the cliff’s wall, meaning untrained attacking forces would be essentially unable to reach them. Arriving on the island of Paros, the first stop had to be the best view on the whole island. That view is, unquestionably, from Agios Antonios on Kefalos Hill. I think you can see why. Pro Tip: If you’re visiting the island of Paros, is your one-stop resource. Athens is home to some of the best walking streets I know of. The neighborhood of Thisseio is chock full of shops, street dining, and charming cafes to relax in. Pro Tip: Use Booking.com to find the best rates on . Seen on postcards and billboards around the world, this iconic view might be the most famous of all. I bet you didn’t know there was a bathroom hiding behind that door 😉 The best sunset on the island of Milos takes place in the traditional Greek village of Plaka. There’s a church there, overlooking the coast, which is the perfect setting for two special somebodies and a bottle of wine. Pro Tip: Visiting Milos? Stay at . A typical view of a traditional Greek village found on almost every Greek island in existence. The typical color scheme of Greece, blue and white, comes from the painted walls of the villages which contrast against the deep blues of the sea and sky. Most notably, these colors can be found on the country’s flag. Pro Tip: If you’re going to Paros, don’t miss dining at , serving some of the best traditional Greek food I’ve ever had. Religion runs deep in Greece, and the famous monasteries of Meteora are no exception. Seen here are two individuals lighting prayer candles inside the Holy Monastery of Great Meteoron. Pro Tip: Visiting Meteora? You definitely want to stay at . One of my favorite islands in the Cyclades, Ios also provided me with some of my favorite pictures of Greece. Climbing to the top of the old city, a church overlooks the whole island and has, without a doubt, the best sunset view on the island. Sarakiniko might be one of the most unique landscapes I’ve ever come across. More reminiscent of something one might find on the moon, Sarakiniko is actually a beach (water not visible in this picture) made of eroded white rocks. Once home to more than 20 monasteries, Meteora, Greece has one of the most important complexes of Greek Orthodox monasteries in the whole country. All built on top of towering sandstone pillars, only six remain today. This is the Monastery of the Holy Trinity overlooking the village of Kalabaka. Ancient Olympia is the site of the first Olympic Games of the 8th century. Just outside the city center, is not only the best hotel in the city, but they have stunning views from the restaurant (like this one) with some of the best Greek food I encountered in the whole country.

Ah Jeremy, these are absolutely stunning photos. I’ve yet to visit Greece but can say that these are some of the most picturesque places on the planet. Even though the weather the weather didn’t cooperate, I loved the Mykonos shot most of all. I’m a cloud person when it comes to photos though, and the drama that a good shot of them can invoke. Thanks for sharing this wonderful collection of photos from your travels in Greece. Take care Jeremy! Thanks, Duke! I love that shot, too 🙂 Those sunsets are incredible and I’d love to visit Meteora.

        "html_text": "Written by and Feb 8, 2020 The iconic images of Greece are irresistible to photographers: majestic ancient monuments, , tiny villages of white-washed houses, and humble domed churches perched on hilltops. The bright southern light of the Mediterranean makes the scenery of Greece especially photogenic. Adding a striking visual element are dramatic color contrasts, such as deep-pink bougainvillea draped across pale-painted buildings and sun-bleached marble ruins overlooking an azure sea. Santorini Island is so spectacularly photogenic that even beginning photographers can capture stunning images. In the charming village of Oia, cobalt-domed churches and whitewashed houses stand on slopes of the volcanic island's caldera, which plunge into the mesmerizing deep blue waters of the Aegean Sea. Oia village is also famous for its beautiful sunsets. Accommodation: The Acropolis in Athens casts a spell of enchantment over modern-day viewers; its colossal ruins evoke the glory of ancient civilization. Perched at the summit of the Acropolis hilltop, the Parthenon is a magnificent classical-era temple that was the most sacred site of Greece in the 4th-century BC. A good vantage point for taking panoramic photos is from Philopappou Hill , directly across from the Acropolis. Accommodation: For photographers, Meteora is one of the most magical places in Greece. Old monasteries perched on rock islands rising from the Plain of Thessaly are a spectacular site. They are built on the top of sheer cliff walls and make perfect subjects for photos. There are several photogenic spots on Mykonos Island, including the historic town, Chora Mykonos , with its narrow winding cobblestone streets and bougainvillea-trimmed whitewashed buildings. The waterfront area of Little Venice (also within the Chora Mykonos) and the island's emblematic windmills provide interesting seaside photo-ops. This alluring waterfront town on the Bay of Chania has an atmospheric harbor developed by the Venetians in the 13th century. Vibrantly painted houses and the outdoor terraces of seafood restaurants and cafés line the waterfront, which seems to glisten in the Mediterranean sunshine. This is one of the . Photographers relish the sunny fishing port of Náoussa, with its simple Cycladic whitewashed houses and traditional Greek boats. Adding a sense of liveliness are the bustling waterfront restaurants and cafés that feature outdoor terraces. An impressive fortified harbor welcomes visitors to the car-free island of Hydra, about a 90-minute ferry ride from Athens and one of the . Hydra Island is a lost-in-time kind of place, where donkeys are still used for transportation. Stately old shipowner's mansions and red-roofed whitewashed houses cluster on hillsides sheltering the port, which sparkles in photos on sunny days. With its ancient ruins overlooking the sea, the clifftop Acropolis of Lindos is one of the most amazing sites to photograph in Greece. The Temple of Athena Lindia (Doric temple dating to the 4th-century BC) and columns of the Propylaea (staircase entrance to the sanctuary) pose for marvelous photos, with the Aegean waters glimmering in the background. The UNESCO-listed Old Town of is renowned for its elegant architecture: Venetian mansions, 19th-century Neoclassical villas, and the French-style arcaded Listón promenade. However, the best photo-op of Corfu Town is from the vantage point of the New Fortress, which affords panoramic views of the city and its lovely seaside setting. The archaeological site of Delphi stands on the slopes of Mount Parnassus overlooking a valley filled with olive groves. Delphi is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of the importance of its 4th-century BC pan-Hellenic sanctuaries. With vistas of mountains in the background, the ruins of the Temple of Athena look especially splendid in photos. Delphi is a , but if you want to visit the site and enjoy the area, plan on spending a night. Another popular tourist destination on Crete is Agios Nikolaos. This small city has several popular sites for photographers. The beautiful port area looks out over Mirabello Bay to mountains on the far shore. Just inland from the port is the small but deep Lake Voulismeni , lined with restaurants and shops and backed by a cliff wall. In the vicinity are some of , including the stunning Voulisma Beach . You can also find a number of nearby. Surrounded by vine-covered rolling hills, olive groves, and pine forests, Kokkari on Sámos Island is an idyllic seaside town with an attractive port. Kokkari was originally a small fishing village, evidenced by the traditional Greek boats moored in the harbor. Nowadays Kokkari is a crowded resort destination during summertime. Folégandros Island's main town, Chora, offers wonderful spots to photograph at every turn: tree-shaded squares, narrow pedestrian alleyways, buildings trimmed in bougainvillea, and quaint whitewashed houses with blue-framed windows and doors. At the highest point of this medieval clifftop town is the Church of Panagia overlooking the Aegean. The steep uphill trek (a 15-minute walk) to the church rewards photographers with the breathtaking seaside panoramas. The seaside village of Assos resembles a watercolor painting. Its picturesque fishing port is tucked into a tranquil bay surrounded by verdant pine forests and lush vegetation. Pretty houses in eye-catching hues nestle on hillsides above the harbor, which is lined with seafood tavernas. Nearby, along the coastline, is the cliff-fringed Myrtos Beach , one of the most often photographed beaches in Greece. Apella Beach on Kárpathos Island seduces visitors with its golden-sand shore and crystal-clear, turquoise waters. Steep cliffs and rocky, pine-clad hillsides surround the beach, giving it a secluded feel. Parga boasts a photogenic waterfront backed by hillsides dotted with colorful houses. Other picture-perfect sights include the hilltop ruins of a Venetian castle and the white church in front of the town's port. On the slopes of a mountain that drops off into the Aegean Sea, the dramatically situated village of Olympos was until recently nearly inaccessible. As a result, the village has retained an old-fashioned way of life. Women wear traditional costumes on religious feast days. Agnontas is a quiet fishing village nestled in a postcard-perfect bay. The surrounding hillsides are covered with dense pine forests, while the serene emerald waters are truly dazzling. Agnontas Bay looks especially romantic at sunset. "
